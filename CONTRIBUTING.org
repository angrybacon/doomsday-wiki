** Testing your Changes

This is a Next.js application written with TypeScript. All you have to do in
order to run the project locally is to clone the repository and install the
JavaScript dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pnpm install  # Install dependencies
pnpm dev      # Run the application on http://localhost:3000
#+END_SRC

See [[./package.json][package.json]] for a complete list of the available

Running the project locally ensures you abide by the existing conventions and
enables live preview for your changes. If for some reason you cannot run the
project locally, Vercel generates and updates URLs for every pull requests on
the repository.

As a general advice, avoid pushing for every little change you make as build
minutes are limited.
