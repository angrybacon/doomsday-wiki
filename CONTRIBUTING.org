** Preamble

Contributions are more than welcome, thank you for considering it!

Pull requests work best, below are guidelines set to help you in the process of
providing work for review.

** Contributing with Content

In a effort to avoid repeating myself and having to maintain things in multiple
places, the Markdown conventions guidelines will live next to the code. Visit
=/sandbox/markdown= anywhere the Wiki is hosted to access the guidelines.

See [[./CONTRIBUTING_WITH_MARKDOWN.org][CONTRIBUTING_WITH_MARKDOWN]].

** Contributing with Code

We're all consenting adults, use history as documentation and as long as you
respect the existing conventions and configured linting tools you can't go very
wrong.

** Testing your Changes

This is a Next.js application written with TypeScript and I'll assume basic
knowledge for a JavaScript stack is known from the reader. All you have to do in
order to run the project locally is to clone the repository and install the
JavaScript dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pnpm install  # Install dependencies
pnpm dev      # Run the application on http://localhost:3000
#+END_SRC

See [[./package.json][package.json]] for a complete list of the available
commands.

Running the project locally ensures you abide by the existing conventions and
enables live preview for your changes. If for some reason you cannot run the
project locally, Vercel generates and updates URLs for every pull requests on
the repository.

As a general advice, avoid pushing for every little change you make as build
minutes are free but limited.
