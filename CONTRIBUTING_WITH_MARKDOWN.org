#+TITLE: Contributing with Markdown
#+AUTHOR: Mathieu Marques

** File Structure

Content consists of chapters and articles under =markdown/=. The chapters are
considered /timeless/ and are the content that should be kept up to date to
account for meta shifts and bannings. Articles on the other hand are dated
content.

- =archive/= ::
  Old content that no longer presents relevance due to bannings or else.
- =articles/= ::
  Dated reports and theories.
- =chapters/= ::
  Most of the content goes there, organized in =ddeft/=, =ddft/= and =meandeck/=
  chapters. There's also =appendices/= for general-purposed resources.
- =partials/= ::
  Static content within the Wiki comes from those partials, this avoids having
  to maintain content alongside code.

** General Markdown Conventions

- Fill your paragraphs to 80 columns
- If your title makes the frontmatter data longer than 80 columns, think of a
  better heading for your document
- Heading levels start at 2 in order to account for the title found in the
  frontmatter
- Don't use unicode quote characters eg. =‘’= and =“”=. They might not render
  properly for everyone so ASCII quotes eg. ='= and ="= should be preferred
- A colon right in front of a word will be interpreted as a /directive/ so make
  sure you have a space right after =:= when it is used as punctuation

** Scryfall

In some contexts, you can refer to card names within Markdown. To ease the writing process, a number of
shorthands for card names can be found [[./src/tools/scryfall/cards.ts][here]].

Optionally, provide a specific set for the representation using the 3-letters
set code. By default, the first print for the card is used.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Full Card Name | SET
#+END_SRC

For instance, =DD | WTH= will scry for /Doomsday/ in the /Weatherlight/ set. To
identify the right code for your set, inspect the links at
https://scryfall.com/sets .

In some specific cases, you will want to specify a collector number. This can be
achieved by suffixing the corresponding number. For instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Duress | STA | 92
#+END_SRC

** Article Banners

Articles can be given a banner representing the art of a card. The banner is
currently only visible from the home page where recent articles are displayed
but they might be inserted at the top of the article in their respective pages.

You can use a Scryfall query inside of the frontmatter in your Markdown file to
set a banner for the article. In doubt, follow existing conventions.

** Custom Constructions

A number of custom directives are parsed within Markdown content. For the
technicalities, the supported specifications for directives in Markdown are
presented
[[https://talk.commonmark.org/t/generic-directives-plugins-syntax/444][here]].

*** Inline Card Links

You can insert inline Scryfall links for cards using the following syntax:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
:card[Brainstorm]
#+END_SRC

This will render an inline link reading "Brainstorm" and pointing to
https://scryfall.com/search?q=!"Brainstorm" .

*** Card Rows

Use this directive to render card images within your Markdown content. Scryfall
queries are supported and you can specify which set to use.

By default rows of cards are rendered with the =CENTERED= variant but you can
specify the variant with the =variant= keyword.

*Centered* rows allocate 25% of the available width for each image. Beyond 4
cards, images start shrinking so that they all fit on one line.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Lion's Eye Diamond | MIR
- Edge of Autumn
- Thassa's Oracle
:::
#+END_SRC

*Pile* rows are rendered using a unique style to make them stand out to the
reader. In addition, they use a fixed width of 20% for each image.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
:::row{variant=PILE}
- Lion's Eye Diamond | MIR
- Edge of Autumn
- Ideas Unbound
- Lotus Petal
- Thassa's Oracle
:::
#+END_SRC

*** Decklists

You can add decklists within your Markdown content, they will rendered as a
collapsible block. Decklist files are located under =decklists/= and should be
dated using a =[year]/[month]/file.txt= or =[year]/[month]/[day]/file.txt=
convention if able. Follow the existing structure as an example. As an
exception, decklist files found directly under =decklists/= are used in
non-dated content to ease maintenance eg. in chapters.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
::decklist{path=path/to/decklist/sans/extension}
#+END_SRC

The content of decklist files supports title, authors and colors metadata.
Columns can be created using blank lines. The following example shows how to
write a decklist file with 2 columns of cards and a 3rd column for the
sideboard. In doubt, follow existing conventions.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
// Title: Dummy Example
// Authors: Author One, Author Two
// Colors: {U}{B}{R}
4 Dark Ritual
4 Doomsday

4 Polluted Delta
1 Island

// Sideboard
1 Duress
#+END_SRC

For more details about color symbols, see the Mana section.

*** Media Embeds

Media embeds are also supported:

For a *SoundCloud* widget, use the following directive and provide its URL.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
::soundcloud{url=https://soundcloud.com/ddftwiki/a-history-of-doomsday}
#+END_SRC

For a *YouTube* widget, provide the ID typically found in the URL behind the =v=
parameter in the address bar.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
::youtube{id=3LLIFHv5kbo}
#+END_SRC

*** Accordions

Collapsible blocks can be stacked against one another or used alone. Provide a
title for the CTA as well as a relative path to the Markdown partial to insert
in the accordion.

Do not specify the extension for the partial, =.md= is always assumed.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
::accordion[Click to expand]{path=path/to/partial/one}
::accordion[Click to expand]{path=path/to/partial/two}
#+END_SRC

** Mana

You can inline mana symbols in Markdown as well as in decklist blocks. When used
collectively, for instance to indicate a list of colors, use the same order as
found on the back of a /Magic: the Gathering/ card. This makes searching for
guilds and clans much easier later on. In doubt, follow existing conventions.

The syntax that was followed during implementation can be found
[[https://mana.andrewgioia.com/icons.html][here]]. Currently only the mana costs
are implemented but loyalty and color indicators may come soon :tm:.
