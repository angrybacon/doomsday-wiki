# Building Double-Doomsday Piles

There are many reasons why you would want to make more storm and cast Tendrils
for some insane amount of lifeloss. Situations like these may even come up quite
frequently in Legacy tournaments: Your opponent may be holding a Swords to
Plowshares, has attacked with a Batterskull, has counters on his Umezawa's
Jitte, or has simply gained some life using his Scavenging Ooze or what not. In
each of these scenarios, it's quite likely that you would want to cast Tendrils
for more than 10 storm, even if it's just to be safe. Now you won't always be
able to go for a Doomsday-Time Spiral pile, and if you can't resolve a Silence
first, Time Spiral isn't a very desirable plan against blue decks or people that
play Mindbreak Trap. In these situations you'd probably want to kill using a
double-Doomsday pile.

Double-Doomsday piles are piles that build up to another Doomsday being cast
that turn, to construct a second pile that builds up to a kill with a very high
storm count.

As a basic requirement in addition to a typical Doomsday win you should remember
that in general you need to produce 3 additional black mana. Sometimes this
three additional mana can be either 1UU or BBB or 2R, which will be written as
[1UU/BBB/2R]. However, this additional cost can basically always be payed for by
mana from Lion's Eye Diamond, so generally it's not very hard to produce. Let's
take a look at a basic double-Doomsday pass-the-turn pile:

```
LED in play, PTT:
-> TW/AoI, LED, GP, DD, BW          1UU/2R (3)         9 Storm
-> TW/AoI, LED, LED, BW(ToA), X
```

Plays out as follows: Cast Doomsday build [TW/AoI, LED, GP, DD, BW] Pass the
turn.

1. Cast TW/AoI, Exile (LED, GP, DD)
2. Cast LED
   - Crack LEDs for BBB and UUU/RRR
3. Cast Doomsday build [TW/AoI, LED, LED, BW, X]
4. Cast GP, draw (TW/AoI)
5. Cast TW/AoI, exile (LED, LED, BW)
6. Cast LED
7. Cast LED
   - Crack LEDs for BBB RRR
8. Cast BW targeting ToA
9. Cast ToA for 9 storm.

You have to realise that from part 4. and on it's just a regular pile. So the
procedure that happened up to the point that you cast the second Doomsday has
cost you [1UU/2R]+BBB to execute, but also produced [1UU/2R], which allows you
to execute a regular pile afterwards. The key thing here is the unique effect of
TW/AoI allowing you to save a draw through the exiled GP even when using LED for
mana.

You can also use CB instead of an exiled cantrip to achieve the same effect.
Let's look at another example:

```
CB in play, GP in hand:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(DD), BW         1UUR   (4)         13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

Plays out as follows:

1. Cast Doomsday build: [IU, LED, LED, BW, BW]
2. Cast GP, draw (IU)
4. Cast IU, draw (LED, LED, BW)
5. Cast LED
6. Cast LED
7. Cast BW for DD, hold priority and crack LEDs for UUU BBB
7. Cast Doomsday build: [IU, LED, LED, GP, BW]
   - Crack CB targeting nothing, draw (IU)
8. Cast IU, draw (LED, LED, GP)
9. Cast LED
10. Cast LED
11. Cast GP, hold priority and crack LEDs for BBB RRR, draw (BW)
12. Cast BW targeting ToA
13. Cast ToA for 13 storm.

This time we have used both the fact that we have wishes and a draw effect
stored to be able to execute the pile. You can also achieve a similar effect
even without wishes.

Example:

```
CB in play, GP in hand:
-> IU, LED, DR, DD, ToA         UUBB   (4)         10 Storm
-> IU, LED, DR, GP, ToA
```

Of course this is much less effective due to the lack of extra 'cards' available
from wishes.

All the above piles can of course be improved through addition of further
cantrips or mana being available in helping facilitate greater storm counts.

## Double-Doomsday without TW/AoI or CB

You might wonder whether we can execute a double-Doomsday pile without CB or
TW/AoI. The answer is yes! But you probably won't ever go for a pile like this
unless some very funky circumstances occur.

Example:

```
-> IU, GP, DD, LED, BW
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

The first problem that arises is that so far we've always sacrificed an LED in
response to our second Doomsday. We did this not just to pay for the draw spells
in the next pile, but also to allow the LED to be included in the second pile.
If you can't sacrifice LED because you are still holding a draw spell, you will
have to build your 2nd pile without it. Thus, increasing the cost of going in to
the double-Doomsday procedure with another LED. So the whole pile becomes:

```
GP + 2x LED:
-> IU, GP, DD, LED, BW           BBB    (3)        14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

Note that all but the first Gitaxian Probe can be payed for by LED mana, so the
life requirement isn't impossible. If you don't have GP to draw into the pile
but a Ponder or Brainstorm the cost is only increased by U. Two Lion's Eye
Diamonds in hand before comboing off is quite a requirement, but you can also
replace one of those Lion's Eye Diamonds with the Burning Wish that you would
otherwise have to tutor up with Doomsday.

To give you some examples:

```
GP + LED + BW:
-> IU, GP, DD, LED, LED          BBB+[1UU/BBB] (6)  13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)

2x GP + LED + BW:
-> LED, IU, GP, DD, LED           BBB   (3)         15 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

## Building Piles as you go

Obviously, there are many more variations and piles than I've listed here. For
example, you could also consider double-Doomsday Piles where you already have
the 2nd Doomsday in hand, in that case you may lower the requirements for cards
in hand by including a LED or CB in the slot of DD in the first pile. The only
downside is that you can't use LED to pay for the Doomsday that is already in
your hand. Unless perhaps you plan to use a Brainstorm somewhere in your spell
chain to put it back, before you draw it again and sacrifice a LED with that
draw effect on the stack. What I'm trying to say is that once you know what
spell chain you are going to use to kill your opponent, it doesn't really matter
anymore how you get there. Your mana, the cards in your hand, and the cards that
you search for with the first Doomsday is what you have to deal with, and
together that should result in a Tendrils of Agony for some high storm count.
That's exactly why many people including myself think we should not strive to
create a full listing of all possible doomsday piles, but rather create a deep
understanding of how to combo off using Doomsday.

## Summary

1. You can use a Double Doomsday pile to enable higher storm piles
2. Double Doomsday piles are handy for pass-the-turn piles
3. Be mindful of the life loss involved in casting Doomsday twice and
   potentially using multiple GP
