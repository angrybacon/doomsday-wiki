I first got into Magic around 2004 but took a break for a few years. After
returning to the game around 2011, I started playing Doomsday in varying forms,
first in proxy Vintage tournaments, and then in Legacy. I finally scraped
together the funds to finish building DDFT in 2015 and have since top 8'd a
handful of win-a-duals, 1k events, and locals, and punted myself out of
contention deep into Day 1 at a large SCG Event. I'm working on improving my
general play-skills and mental stamina in the hopes of finally having a result
at a large event.
