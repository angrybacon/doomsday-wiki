# Brainstorm in Doomsday

Brainstorm is one of the most powerful, if not controversial, spells available
in the Legacy format at this time. There have been numerous articles written on
this 'seemingly innocuous at first glance' one mana cantrip. I will be glossing
over the main discussion of this card and instead focus on the specifics of
using it as a part of or to initiate your doomsday piles. In many cases it can
be used as any other cantrip. If you have say 2UR available post Doomsday then
it is perfectly fine to build a very basic pile to win with.

One of the more difficult things of playing Doomsday storm combo is recognizing
situations where you have the resources to win. Beginning players often start
out with learning only a few piles by heart. While this helps with getting
started, there will be many chances to win that they will miss out on.

The key thing to understand is that Brainstorm can exchange a few cards in your
hand with the top of your Doomsday pile. This enables many new lines of play
that will allow the Doomsday player to win in situations where the basic piles
would not.

Let's discuss some examples:

You have U available. You have just cast Doomsday so storm count = 1. Your hand
is BS and BW. Let's assess what we have and look at the most basic of piles to
compare it with:

```
-> [TW/AoI], LED, LED, GP, BW            BBB+U+[1UU/2R] (7)   9 Storm

-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW                  BBB+U+UU (6)         9 Storm
```

As we can see, we now have already available our finishing spell (BW). This lets
us save a slot in the stack to play around with as we can use the BS to insert
the BW from our hand into the pile. As a result, we have obtained the finisher,
we just need to consider mana and a way to 'draw' our cards.

Examples:

```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, [TW/AoI], GP, LED, LED          BBB+U (4)             9 Storm

BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, IU, GP, LP, LED                 BBB+2U (6)            9 Storm
```

Example one:

1. Cast Doomsday, build: [LED, TW/AoI, GP, LED, LED]
2. Cast BS, draw (LED, TW/AoI, GP) and replace (TW/AoI, BW)
3. Cast LED
4. Cast GP, hold priority cracking LED for UUU or RRR, draw (TW/AoI)
5. Cast TW/AoI, exile (BW, LED, LED)
6. Cast LED (6)
7. Cast LED (7)
   - Crack LEDs for BBB and RRR
8. Cast BW targeting ToA
9. Cast ToA for 9 Storm.

Thanks to BS we are able to exchange the BW in the pile with another LED. This
concept of swapping can be used for many aspects of piles. In this example it
means we can go off with just U open with any number of the following cards in
hand:

LED, GP, [TW/AoI], BW, LM

Example two:

This follows exactly the same as example one however we require an additional 2
generic mana to pull it off.

1. Cast Doomsday, build: [LED, IU, GP, LED, LP]
2. Cast BS, draw (LED, TW/AoI, GP) and replace (IU, BW)
3. Cast LED
4. Cast GP, hold priority cracking LED for UUU or RRR, draw (IU)
5. Cast IU, draw (BW, LED, LLP)
6. Cast LED (6)
7. Cast LP (7)
   - Crack LP for R
8. Cast BW targeting ToA, hold priority and crack LED for BBB
9. Cast ToA for 9 Storm.

Again the same concept applies however we do need one extra mana. The difference
comes from the fact that we draw BW with IU, as opposed to exiling it with TW or
AoI. The fact that BW is in our hand means that we can not use LED to pay for
it. The Lotus Petal in the pile is used to generate R, which together with the U
left floating after IU is enough to cast BW. LED is sacrificed for black in
response to produce black mana, where one additional generic mana is needed to
cast ToA.

Nevertheless both the above examples are cheap piles requiring relatively low
resources. Assuming the opponent is at enough life and you have ToA in your
maindeck you can also build the following as pile:

```
BS, ToA in hand.
-> LED, IU, GP, DR, LP                       BBB+U (4)   8 Storm
```

It follows the same lines of play as the above examples but does not require LED
after the initial one used to cast IU as LP, DR and the U remaining after IU is
enough to cast ToA.

Sometimes, we can get around the IU LED mana restriction simply by having extra
cards in our hands. Notice that in the example above we drew IU only to put it
back with Brainstorm, which is not very useful by itself. If we already had IU
in hand, we could draw any card of our choice from the pile and put back IU.
Since we get to put back two cards, we can put back IU and any other card in
hand to effectively use Brainstrom as a draw-3 spell.

The reason this trick does not work for when we have BW in hand is that we can
only put back two cards with BS, if those cards have to be IU and BW we cannot
exchange any additional cards in hand with cards in the pile.

Say we have BS, IU, and one card in hand. We cast Doomsday and build:

```
BS, IU, X in hand.
-> LED, LED, GP, LED, BW
```

1. Cast Doomsday, build: [LED, LED, GP, LED, BW]
2. Cast BS, draw (LED, LED, GP) and replace (IU, X)
3. Cast LED
4. Cast LED
5. Cast GP, hold priority and crack LEDs for UUU, RRR, draw (IU)
6. Cast IU draw (X, LED, BW)
7. Cast LED
8. Cast BW targetting ToA, hold priority and crack LED for BBB
9. Cast ToA for Storm = 9.

Obviously storm can be +1 if you are able to cast X prior to BW.

Finally let us now consider this scenario; BS and BW in hand. 1UR available.
Doomsday has been cast therefore Storm Count =1.  
For argument's sake let us also state that your maindeck draw spell (IU, TW,
AoI) has been exiled for whatever reasons. We can still work with this scenario.

Example:

```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, GP, LED, LED, BW               BBB+1UR   (6) 9 Storm
```

1. Cast Doomsday, build: [LED, GP, LED, LED, BW]
2. Cast BS, draw (LED, GP, LED) and replace (BW, LED)
3. Cast LED
4. Cast GP, hold priority and crack LED for RRR, draw (BW)
5. Cast BW targeting AoI in the SB
6. Cast AoI, exile (LED, LED, BW)
7. Cast LED
8. Cast LED
   - Crack LEDs for BBB and RRR
9. Cast BW targetting ToA
10. Cast ToA for Storm = 10.

Again this playline can be followed with two BW in hand, BW and GP in hand or
other sets of cards.

## Summary

1. You can use BS to exchange resources between your hand and the pile
2. Don't fixate on specific lines, just remember general rules
