# Time Spiral Piles

One of the reasons you sometimes see a Time Spiral in Doomsday sideboards is
because we can efficiently use it in Doomsday Piles for large amounts of storm.
In my opinion these piles fill up a niche between the requirements of Chain of
Vapor piles and that of double-Doomsday piles, which are both useful for
generating high stormcounts. Time Spiral also comes with limitations, you will
give your opponent a fresh 7 card hand.

The cost listed in square brackets [..] is assumed to be payed for by the lands
that are untapped by Time Spiral. The listed stormcounts do not include for
cards that may be cast for no other purpose then to build storm. In other words,
cards like Conjurer's Bauble are assumed to not be recast post-Time Spiral. For
most piles only the Lion's Eye Diamonds and Burning Wish into Tendrils of Agony
are counted towards storm, in order to list the lowest possible post-Time Spiral
mana cost.

A simple example of a pile that uses Time Spiral is as follows:

```
GP + 1 card (in hand or post-DD graveyard):
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+1UUR+[1R] (7) 11 Storm
```

If you have no other cards in hand or your post-Doomsday graveyard resolving
Time Spiral will kill you. The Doomsday you've cast to build this pile typically
ends up as the only card in your graveyard, with 5 cards in your pile this adds
up to 6. However, the Burning Wish used to wish for Time Spiral exiles itself,
so that's only 5 cards. That's is why you need at least 2 arbitrary cards in
your hand or post-Doomsday graveyard to not kill yourself. You may also have
more than 2 extra cards and be unable to get rid of them. This can be a problem
as important cards may end up in your library rather than your hand after Time
Spiral has resolved. This usually isn't a problem, unless your only draw spell
is Brainstorm and the number of cards left in your library is less than 3 or
when there are more cards left in your library than you reach with your draw
spells, but these situations are quite rare. Given that you have at least 2
extra cards that you may cast before and after the Time Spiral, as long as they
don't exile themselves or other cards, you might be able to up to storm to well
beyond 11.

Also note that the listed cost assumes that you can produce 1R with the lands
that you untap with Time Spiral. This is important because if you don't have any
lands that produce red mana, and none of your 'extra' cards are Lotus Petal or
Lion's Eye Diamond, you have to add R to the listed cost for the pile.

Executing a Doomsday-Time Spiral pile will become much easier if you have some
resources that can produce red mana, like a Lion's Eye Diamond or Lotus Petal.
Considering the following piles:

```
GP + LED:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+UU+[1] (5) 13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+R+[1R] (4) 13 Storm
```

These piles are also good examples of that you can sometimes pay 3 mana instead
of 2 before Time Spiral in order to float a red mana and thus combo off without
a land that produces red. However, if you that 3 additional mana that is any of
1UU or BBB you could also build a double doomsday pile.

## Using additional cantrips for cheaper piles

Having access to a draw effect rather than a Lion's Eye Diamond is unfortunately
less effective in Doomsday-Time Spiral piles. Consider the following
(intentionally bad) example:

```
CB in play + GP:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+2UU+[1R] (7) 11 Storm
```

These piles are very inefficient and in these situations it would be better to
build a double-Doomsday pile, which costs BBB+UUU or BBB+BBB if you have SDT+GP.

It is not possible to turn additional draw effects into mana, because we don't
have enough room in the pile and the whole procedure is also quite expensive
mana-wise: IU=2 + BW=2 + TS=6 = 10 mana, with another 1R post-TS. As the 2
Burning Wishes and the Ideas Unbound already take up 3 spots, we only have room
for 2 Lion's Eye Diamonds and these can be easily drawn by Ideas Unbound, extra
draw is not going to help.

It's important to understand that the only way we can build cheaper piles is to
cram more acceleration spells into the pile. Since IU and 2 BW already consume 3
slots, the only way we in which we can lower the mana cost of the pile is to
replace any of these with LEDs. This is of course only possible if you already
have Ideas Unbound or Burning Wish before casting Doomsday. The slot that is
freed up will be used for an additional Lion's Eye Diamond. Examples:

```
CB in play + IU in hand:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+UU+[1] (5) 12 Storm

GP + IU in hand:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+UU+[1] (5) 13 Storm
```

Rather straightforward, cast IU to draw 3 LEDs that produce 9 mana. Then tap SDT
or play GP to draw the Burning Wish sacrificing the LEDs in response. As Burning
Wish + Time Spiral is only 8 mana, you can float R after casting Time Spiral and
only need 1 more mana from your lands post-TSP to cast the Burning Wish for
Tendrils of Agony.

Similarly, if you already have a Burning Wish before casting Doomsday, you might
cram another LED into the pile:

```
2x GP + BW in hand or graveyard:
-> LED, IU, LED, LED, BW BBB+R+[1R] (4) 14 Storm
-> LED, IU, LED, LED, BW BBB+1R+[1] (5) 14 Storm
```

Now these last few piles use 3 extra cards rather than 2, meaning that you may
likely have 8 cards in your library before Time Spiral draws 7. This could
result in a situation where a crucial card, like Burning Wish, ends up in your
library rather than your hand after Time Spiral. Be aware of the possibility,
but this usually isn't a problem.

## Using Brainstorm to draw into Doomsday-Time Spiral piles

Since we need some extra cards to not kill ourselves with Time Spiral anyways,
we can use Brainstorm to efficiently draw multiple cards. Consider the following
pile:

```
BS in hand + 2 cards:
-> P, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+2UU+[1R] (7) 11 Storm
```

Now this pile is quite efficient, the mana cost is similar to having an Ideas
Unbound+1 card in hand instead of Brainstorm, but we replaced Ideas Unbound in
the pile with a Ponder that doesn't lower the mana cost. It's best to use a
Ponder here to draw the Burning Wish that is the 3rd card in our pile. Although
Brainstorm and Sensei's Divining Top (at -U+2 mana) also work. The advantage of
Ponder over Brainstorm here is that if you need a card that is stuck in your
post-Time Spiral library you can use Ponder to draw it, where using Brainstorm
with less than 3 cards in your library would kill you.

Because the Time Spiral piles can only get more efficient if we can replace the
IU or BWs in the pile, we seek to use Brainstorm as a draw3 and forgo the use of
Ideas Unbound entirely. The problem is that in the above pile Ideas Unbound was
replaced by a Ponder, which doesn't bring us any closer to lowering the cost of
the pile. However if we already have a cantrip we can stuff another LED in the
pile.

```
BS/Ponder + Brainstorm + 2 cards:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+UU+[1] (5) 13 Storm

CB in play + Brainstorm + 2 cards:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW BBB+U+[1R] (5) 12 Storm
```

And if you have either a BW or a cantrip, but less cards in total, you might as
well use Brainstorm to end up with 2 LEDs and a cantrip, while Burning Wish is
on top of your library.

```
BS + BW + GP:
-> LED, LED, BW, LP, LP BBB+2U+[1] (6) 13 Storm

BS + GP + 1 card:
-> LED, LED, BW, BW, LP BBB+2U+[1] (6) 12 Storm
```

+1 storm if you cast GP post-TSP. The Lotus Petals can be included to lower the
post-TS cost of the pile, but when you have sufficient lands you may also
include other cards like Silence or even Chain of Vapor.

## Summary

I hope this gives a good overview of what Doomsday-Time Spiral piles are out
there. Obviously, I have only touched upon the subject and the total number of
piles that may be created is much larger. So things to remember are:

1. You want at least 2 cards, beyond what you search with Doomsday
2. You need 2 Burning Wishes, one for Time Spiral, one for Tendrils of Agony
3. Additional cantrips can lower the manacost if you can replace either IU or
   some of the BWs in the pile with LEDs
4. Instead of lowering the mana cost by adding LEDs you might as well include
   cards like Silence/Chain of Vapor/Slaughter Pact/Lotus Petal
5. These examples intentially do not use TW or AoI. Both of these work badly
   with Time Spiral as they remove cards from the game that are needed to ensure
   your card count reaches seven post TS.
