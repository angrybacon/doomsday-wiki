** Coding Conventions

*** TypeScript

- Respect existing conventions
- Respect the =eslint= configuration
- Respect the =prettier= configuration

A commit hook exists to check for ESLint errors and warnings to validate your
commits. It only validates the content of your commits.

*** Styles

Prefer the component styling properties when it makes sense, or the =sx=
property from =@mui/system= otherwise.

** TODO Commit Conventions

- Branch name
- Commit hooks
- Commit naming
- Pull request naming

** Mocks

In order to both reduce the strain on Scryfall's API and allow offline
development, various mocks were set up. See =src/mocks/handlers.ts= for their
implementations and payloads. To disable the mocks, override the value for
=MOCK_SCRYFALL= in a =.env.local= at the root of the project.

** TODO Tests

- =jest=
- =react-testing-library=
- Coverage report
