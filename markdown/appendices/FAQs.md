title: Frequently asked Questions

Compiled here is a list of frequently asked questions observed from the Discord
or other sources (Twitter, Reddit, video comment threads etc). If you believe a
key question is missing then please feel free to suggest it. A lot of the questions
were either fully or partially answered in this article here: [DDFAQs](/articles/2020/03/22/ddfaq/)


### 1. What are the different Doomsday decks and what is the difference between them?

There are considered, at the time of writing, to be 4 primary distinct variants of Doomsday
available for play. These comprise of DDFT, DDEFT, "Meandeck" Doomsday and Entombsday. 

 - DDFT (Doomsday Fetchland Tendrils) is the closest to historical lists. Although it adopts
   the current usage of Thassa's Oracle these decks tend to also have access to secondary
   Storm plans using cards like Burning Wish, Echo of Eons and Tendrils of Agony. They also 
   prefer proactive protection such as Duress over being able to run reactive counter magic. 
   
 - DDEFT (Doomsday Experimental Frenzy Tendrils) is now an outdated style. This was the main
   variant available post Gitaxian Probe ban and pre-printing of Thassa's Oracle. These lists
   use Experimental Frenzy as a card advantage engine and win condition in tandem with Doomsday. 
   
 - Meandeck Doomsday is the primary deck variant that is having previously unprecedented success
   since the printing of Thassa's Oracle. Meandeck Doomsday uses counter magic like Force of Will
   and Daze to play a controlling game before ending the game with Doomsday. The moniker "Meandeck"
   is explained in this article [here](/articles/2020/03/12/pretty-mean-deck/). 
   
 - Entombsday is more of a Tin Fins variant with a main deck plan focussing on reanimating Griselbrand
   using either Shallow Grave or Goryo's Vengeance to then have it attack alongside Emrakul, the Eons Torn
   or, looping the deck to cast an infinite number of Collective Brutalitys or a lethal Tendrils of Agony. 
   The key point ot focus on is it runs a dedicated transformational sideboard into effectively a variant
   of Meandeck Doomsday. 
   
### 2. What is the *best* Doomsday archetype? Of that archetype what are the *best* colours to run?

Meandeck Doomsday has the most proven results of the archetypes listed above with a 2020 performance that 
outnumbers TCDeck numbers of the previous 10 years preceeding it for all archetypes (excluding 5-0 publications).
It also had a high number of top 32 finishes in the Eternal Weekend events for 2020. 

Within Meandeck Doomsday there is no definitive *best* colour configuration to run. Success has been had with
straight UB, BUG, Grixis, 4 colour (no W) and Esper lists across the year with most decks having an almost
entirely UB main deck configuration. The tools that are effective and provided by each colour depend on the meta
at the time and the pilot's preferences in deck building. 

### 3. What list should I start on? What is the best list to play?

If you want a proven and effective list then look at either top placing finishers for high player events on
[TCDecks](https://www.tcdecks.net/archetype.php?archetype=Doomsday&format=Legacy) or head to the Doomsday 
discord server and check out the #decklists-archive. Successful lists and placements are posted there regularly
to ensure new technology / strategy is communicated out. There is no defined *best* list so just go with the 
list/lists that seem to be most prevalent as those are likely to be considered *best* at the time.

### 4. Is there a list of common/all Doomsday piles? What is the most common pile I should learn?

### 5. What is the best matchup for the deck?

### 6. What is the worst matchup for the deck?

### 7. What's a good meta to play Doomsday in?

### 8. I think X card might be good, should I run it?

### 9. Is the deck hard to learn? Is it the most difficult deck in Legacy?

### 10. How do I resolve Doomsday in paper?

### 11. How long should I be taking to resolve Doomsday in paper?

### 12. I run X deck, how do I beat Doomsday?

Haha, nice try! But you won't catch us out that easily! In all seriousness if you pop into the Discord there are
plenty of people who would be happy to discuss the matchup from the other side of things. We're a friendly bunch
and always open to bouncing ideas around.
