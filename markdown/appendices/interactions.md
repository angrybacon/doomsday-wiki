title: Interesting Interactions
---

This appendix describes important card interactions that may not be obvious to a
DDFT beginner.

## Your Interactions

#### Act on Impulse

Exiling cards doesn't count as drawing, so you cannot lose (or win) by casting
an AoI when 2 cards remain in your library. Cards exiled with Act on Impulse can
be cast, but their activated abilities cannot be used. For example, a Street
Wraith cannot be cycled from an Act on Impulse exile.

#### Conjurer's Bauble

Only target a card if you must, never do it just for value, because if the
targeted card is removed from the graveyard by your opponent then the bauble
activation will fizzle and you will not draw a card.

#### Chromatic Sphere

Chromatic Sphere's activated ability is a mana ability. Mana abilities do not go
on the stack, therefore your opponent cannot respond to this activation.
Chromatic Sphere allows you to play around creature removal with Laboratory
Maniac piles because you can play Chromatic Sphere, Laboratory Maniac, and then
activate Chromatic Sphere without your opponent having priority to cast their
removal.

#### Lake of the Dead

Lake of the Dead does not enter the battlefield until after a swamp is
sacrificed. Therefore, it is not possible to do any tricks like activating it in
response to that trigger. You really do need 2 swamps in play in order to
activate this card, and those swamps will be destroyed by playing and activating
it. Lake of the Dead's activation is a mana ability and does not go on the
stack.

#### Lion's Eye Diamond

As in any Storm deck, LED can be cracked in response to cantrips such as
Brainstorm, Ponder, Preordain, Gitaxian Probe, and Conjurer's Bauble. Holding
priority while casting these cantrips, by announcing "Brainstorm, holding
priority," or holding the Control key on MTGO while casting Brainstorm, will
allow you to crack the LED and discard your hand but still have the mana as you
draw in to the next card of your library. Failing to announce that you are
holding priority allows your opponent to say "OK" and then you will draw your
next card and not have the mana from LED and have no way to get that mana
without discarding your newly drawn card.

## Opponent Interactions

#### Flickerwisp

An opponent can cause headaches with an Aether Vial on 3 and a Flickerwisp in
hand, since they are able to Exile cards at critical times in your sequencing.
The disruptive cards that Flickerwise can exile are LED, Conjurer's Bauble,
Chromatic Sphere, Laboratory Maniac, or a Land in response to an unresolved Rain
of Filth on the stack.

#### Aven Mindcensor

If there is an Aven Mindcensor on the board, a resolved Doomsday will be able to
search only the top 4 cards of the library and the entire graveyard. Selecting 1
card from the top 4 does not allow you to dig one deeper in to your library.

#### Pithing Needle

Pithing needle cannot stop LED, Lotus Petal, Chromatic Sphere, or Doomsday
(players try naming Doomsday due to the strange wording on the Weatherlight
printing since it appears like activated abilities do.) Pithing needle can stop
Conjurer's Bauble and Fetchlands.

#### Phyrexian Revoker

Phyrexian Revoker can stop LED, Lotus Petal, Chromatic Sphere, or Conjurer's
Bauble. It cannot hit Doomsday or Fetchlands.

#### Grindstone, Predict, Thought Scour, Surgical Extraction

These cards have the ability to disturb the ordering or contents of your library
at instant speed, when you draw in to your pile.

#### Portent

Can reorder your library at sorcery speed. Interferes with PTT piles.

#### Stifle

Can stop Conjurer's Bauble activations, Tendrils of Agony and Empty the Warrens
Storm triggers, and Fetchlands. Does not stop Chromatic Sphere, Lake of the
Dead, Rain of Filth, Lotus Petal, or LED.
