title: The Doomsday Arsenal - A list of potentially playable cards
---

## Table of Contents

## Preamble

This is a list of potential Doomsday playables that have been historically
tried and are considered either off-meta, that is to say playable but maybe
only useful in specific circumstances or with certain metagame portions in
mind or are perhaps "too cute" to run and should probably be ommitted from a
list unless you really wish to play them (because everyone should be having
fun with their respective lists!). Each card will have a discussion one how
much it has been tried, it's benefits, what it might replace in a common list
and any weaknesses or considerations it may have associated with it. 

### Quicken

:::row{variant=centered}
- Quicken
:::

Quicken is a cantrip effect that can be used to try and help power out your
Doomsday within an opponent's turn or in other tricky situations for your
opponent. Unfortunately the benefit of enabling this, even with a replacement
card draw attached, is not really worth the slot. The deck already boasts a
high density or card filtering/searching and card draw enablers which means
Quicken has to compare itself against both cycling effects from cards like
card:[SW] and cantrips like card:[Pnd], card:[Pre] and card:[Con] all of
which are likely the cards that would be replaced. If you really wanted to
have an effect that allows these instant speed interactions (because who doesn't
love casting card:[Tsz] in an opponent's draw step) then card:[Teferi, Time Ravaler]
is likely better on all accounts other than the colour requirement.

### Tutors (Grim Tutor/Scheming Symmetry/Wishclaw Talisman/etc)

:::row{variant=centered}
- Grim Tutor
- Infernal Tutor
- Profane Tutor
- Scheming Symmetry
- Solve the Equation
- Wishclaw Talisman
:::

There are many tutor effects available in Legacy however many are considered
to be very archetype specific. Some of the options presented have significant 
flaws or limitations that make them unsuitable for current iterations of
Doomsday. card:[Infernal Tutor] is too reliant on the card:[LED] and works
poorly with a lot of the interaction slots the deck runs like card:[FoW]
and card:[Daze]. card:[Scheming Symmetry] provides the opportunity for
your opponent to either find their best piece of interaction or their own
enabler for progressing their game plan, especially dangerous if against
other fast combo like Oops All Spells or TES. card:[Grim Tutor] and
card:[Solve the Equation] both provide solid tutor effects but at 3 mana
and being sorcery only they are slow. Grim Tutor also has a life cost which
can be costly to the deck. 

Of the options above, card:[Wishclaw Talisman]
is probably the most effective in terms of usage however it still suffers
from not being as fast as the currently played alternatives of card:[PT] and
card:[LDV] which it would replace and is open to opposing permanent hate
like card[Abrupt Decay], card:[Collector Ouphe] and card:[Prismatic Ending].
If you were less concerned with speed and more concerned about card efficiency
and were happy playing a slower game then Wishclaw or Solve the Equation would
be the most viable alternatives.

card:[Profane Tutor] has been experimented with a lot and can be a decent choice
for lists. The card is best utilised on turn 2 which means, in theory, you want
a high number of copies where possible to ensure it is found early on. 
Unfortunately, as additional later copies of the card beyond this turn are not 
useful, running high numbers of it can lead to a lot of dead draws from the deck.
It also suffers the same issues as some of the other alternatives with speed being
lost from its use.

### Wishes (Burning Wish/Death Wish/Wish)

:::row{variant=centered}
- Burning Wish
- Death Wish
- Wish
:::

Wishes are often discussed as a way to increase the number of pseudo copies of 
Doomsday within your deck. The most common one discussed is card:[BW] in regards
to its mana efficiency and ability to also find a number of strong 'toolbox' spells
however because of the requirement to add in a significant red splash to the main
deck configuration to enable it (given the majority of lists are purely blue-black
without sideboarding) many people look to card:[Death Wish] as a possible alternative.
Unfortunately none of the current "wish" effects are as efficient as the "tutor" 
equivalents card:[PT] and card:[LDV] in terms of mana cost/flexibility. They also generally
promote a slower style of play which would tend to omit tutor effects anyway for 
potentially additional card advantage engines. If you were to run them then they
would probably replace any tutor effects in your deck but are not recommended.

### Baleful Strix

:::row{variant=centered}
- Baleful Strix
:::

Baleful Strix is a great card that can sometimes feel a bit off in a combo shell. 
It acts as a multifaceted tool that both helps delay opposing aggression whilst
still cantripping and allowing you to keep a high blue count in your card pool.
When Strix is played it normally replaces some number of cyclers or other
interaction slots because it tends to promote a slower pace of gameplay. Quite
often it is run alongside other tools that synergise with it. Things like
card:[Cabal Therapy], card:[Unearth] or a general more controlling or creature
-centric build.

### Unearth

:::row{variant=centered}
- Unearth
:::

Unearth was very popular as the current style of the deck was explored. It paired
well with card:[Predict] which many were running and held its own in a vacuum
thanks to the cycling allowing it to be thrown back if uneeded. These days it
is considered a little too cute as it requires the use of the graveyard and
doesn't fit properly with the style of deck many play. Despite this it's still
perfectly playable alongside Strixes/Striges and other creature plans and can
function as an alternative to a second Oracle in piles.

### Creatures (Uro, Mentor, Sedgemoor Witch, Gurmag)

:::row{variant=centered}
- Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath
- Monastery Mentor
- Sedgemoor Witch
- Gurmag Angler
:::

There are a lot of creatures which could be added to the list above but these are
the examples picked. The idea in having these creatures is to change the style of
the deck to enable two angles of attack; the conventional one winning with 
Doomsday and Oracle and the alternate plan which pressures life total. Sometimes
opponent's can overextend with cards like card:[Sylvan Library] to find that their
life total matters all of a sudden. It also makes them have to consider retaining
things like removal in a situation where maybe they would otherwise prefer to have
other types of disruption.

Sometimes the creature plan is light in the main deck but much heavier after
sideboarding as part of a partial or complete transformational package. There are
definitely ways that you can capitalise on the surprise factor as a result of it
but do be aware, one of the pitfalls in running such a sideboard plan can be
an over-reliance on transforming and a lack of trust/extreme dilution of plan
A.

There are ways you can focus more on the creature plan with the early 2022 dubbing
of "Tempo Doomsday" lists but be warned it will skew certain matchups out of favour
and sometimes result in very clunky hands or gameplans with the wrong parts
of both sides being found.

### Multi-draw Spells (Predict, Night's Whisper, Expressive Iteration)

:::row{variant=centered}
- Predict
- Night's Whisper
- Expressive Iteration
:::

Traditionally Ideas Unbound is the "Multi-draw" tool that is used to try and dig
multiple cards into a pile whilst enabling added protection in your hands or the 
greatest resource efficiency. Outside of the combo however, the card is somewhat
lackluster and thus many look towards arguably "better" cards in a vacuum to take
the slot.

Predict is the most popular of these and has been shown to be perfectly viable as
an alternative with plenty of historical use examples from 2020 onwards. The main
positives include synergising really well with the cantrip shell of the deck and
being able to facilitate a longer game. The issues with it include the fact it only
draws 2 cards, not 3, and it risks a card to the graveyard in the face of many
shuffle effects like Surgical Extraction or Boseiju, Who Endures which can result in
upsets hitting Oracle itself or forcing a turn pass you can't afford. It's very viable
but is likely slightly weaker in a dedicated Doomsday list.

Night's Whisper is another commonly suggested alternative. It pairs very strongle with 
excess {B} mana from ritual effects and is a strong card in its own right pre-combo.
Unfortunately only drawing two cards plus having life loss after Doomsday resolves
can be limiting / costly, especially if having to be paired with Street Wraith cycles
or Force pitch casting. It's a fine card but normally gets paired alongside Ideas Unbound
rather than replacing it.

Expressive Iteration is an incredibly potent card with it allowing selective filtering
and card advantage. Because of the way it is worded you could in theory use it to 
dig into a pile and draw LED, exiling something to then be able to cast with the LED
mana. Generally though the mana cost and specific wording of it is a little restrictive.
Making {U}{R} in a deck that wants to go from {B}{B}{B} to {U}{U} can be tricky, 
especially with so many mana denial elements omni-present in the format. The order of
operations on the card also mean that if you are in a position to cast it with only two
cards left in your deck, you would put one into your hand and one back into the deck.
An excellent card for pre-combo play but not brilliant for after Doomsday resolves.

### Mill Cantrips (Mental Note, Thought Scour)

:::row{variant=centered}
- Mental Note
- Thought Scour
:::

Before Consider arrived on the scene, these were two options for being able to dig three
cards deep into your pile. They do have benefits similar to consider such as being instant
speed and thus allowing to dig three through Narset, Parter of Veils / Spirit of the Labyrinth
however only allowing one card to be drawn means you have to have a good payoff to get to
(something like Unearth for example having milled an Oracle) and unlike Surveil, (which Consider
basically has) there is no "may" clause for the mill so if you get hit by a Surgical extraction for
example you could have your day ruined quite considerably. You also cannot use these cleanly 
in the same Brainstorm piles you can use Consider in because they need to have the single mill 
clause only to be effective. The cards are fine but honestly Consider is just better.

### Echo of Eons

:::row{variant=centered}
- Echo of Eons
:::

Echo of Eons is one of the various "draw 7" effects that have existed in Magic and one of the few that
are legal in Legacy. It can be a very powerful tool allowing for some unique pile construction that plays
well around Endurance or makes good use of Lion's Eye Diamond. If you run a list with an excess of Ritual
effects you can ply extra {B} into the flashback cost for Echo and cards like Predict or Consider allow
you to easily place it into the yard. You have to be wary though as you can deck yourself with the card
if you miscount and forget it exiles itself. There are also plenty of issues you could run into such as
Hullbreacher that can punish such plays. This fits into the "probably a singleton for pile purposes but
running a second Oracle likely does the same thing" category of cards.

 ### Disruption/ Removal (Drown in the Loch, Collective Brutality)

:::row{variant=centered}
- Drown in the Loch
- Collective Brutality
:::

These cards can be vary powerful allowing for a nice mix of flexibility and utility whilst being within the
deck's core colours. The issue with them normally stems from the fact that two mana in Legacy is quite a
lot and neither of these options presented are guaranteed to be effective in every matchup. If you are playing
a slower, more controlling variant then they might have space as a one-of but I would not recommended running
them.

 ### Alternative Discard (Inquisition of Kozilek, Cabal Therapy)
 
:::row{variant=centered}
- Inquisition of Kozilek
- Cabal Therapy
::: 

Inquisition of Kozilek is an interesting card in Legacy. It hits 90% of all relevant things you want it to
without any life loss associated with it. The big issue, and this can be very relevant, is it does not hit
Force of Will. Force is still the most prevalent piece of {U} interaction you will face and thus you need to
have your own interaction be able to deal with it. Inqusition can be played but only after you have justified
not running the full set of Duress or Thoughtseize.

Cabal Therapy alas has had its hayday and now just doesn't pack the same punch. These days with so many decks
running such a mix of potential interaction, and without the help of Gitaxian Probe or sacrificial creatures
to abuse the flashback with, it is more than likely this card will now read "look at target opponent's hand
and feel remorse over the good ol' days as your name of 'Force of Will' sees Pyrolast, Dress Down and 
Force of Negation." It can be a useful tool in niche situations involving sacrificing your own Oracle but unless
you are running things like Baleful Strix to truly squeeze value from it, it just cannot compete these days.
