This page serves as a repository of Doomsday decklists past and present. Those
under *Current Decklists* are considered stock lists of the currently playable
Doomsday variants, and we'll do our best to keep them up to date. In the
*Historical Decklists* section are examples of lists from the past. Most are
unplayable due to bannings, while some are still legal but have been obviated by
new printings.

## Current Decklists

Since the printing of :card[Thassa's Oracle], an old friend resurged from the
dead: Meandeck Doomsday. The list plays a more reactive role in most matchups
and focuses on building resources before going off. Since TO is so compact and
cheap compared to its predecessors, it can still allow for quick win with an
actual long game plan.

::decklist{path=meandeck.ubr}

::decklist{path=meandeck.wub}

::decklist{path=meandeck.ubg}

::decklist{path=meandeck.ubrg}

Multiple 5-0's and 1K top 8's, as well as a MTGO Challenge top8's to its name.
This is a proven list based around Experimental Frenzy that is also moderately
easier to play than lists of the past.

::decklist{path=ddeft}

A new development utilizing some powerful 2019 cards. Though it has yet to
achieve a notable result, testing indicates that it is comparable in winrate to
the Frenzy list. It is closer in playstyle to the lists of yore, so if you're
looking for something more challenging or nostalgic that doesn't sacrifice
power, try this list.

## Historical Decklists

A list from just after the Gitaxian Probe ban, but before Experimental Frenzy.
It looks quite similar to the Echo list, and in fact served as a source of
inspiration to the construction of that list.

::decklist{path=2018/12/ddft}

After the banning of :card[Sensei's Divining Top], the deck changed its shape a
little bit. The number of copies of Lotus Petal was increased to pump up the
speed, since without Top the ability to grind was diminished. :card[Conjurer's
Bauble] saw its first appearance as a *stored draw* like Top was, and as a way
to loop cards back into Doomsday piles.

::decklist{path=2018/06/ddft}

The classic list, considered by many to be the most playable form of the deck.
It was built to beat the Miracles decks of the day, and the maindeck copies of
:card[Abrupt Decay] and the full playset of Top helped it play a long game and
muscle through :card[Counterbalance]. :card[Shelldock Isle] and Emrakul,
:card[Xantid Swarm], and more decays gave it a strong sideboard plan against the
slow blue decks.

RiP Sensei's Divining Top.

::decklist{path=2017/08/ddft}

This is the earliest Doomsday list I could find. There are some clear
similarities with the classic list but also some weird ANT-like aspects mixed
in. It looks very unrefined, but you can see a lot of the hallmarks of later
Storm decks. An interesting piece of history but not remotely playable, and not
only because of the banned cards.
