DDEFT is a Doomsday variant set on lining up quick loopable and durable Doomsday
kills through the card :card[Experimental Frenzy].

This high value enchantment allows us to work off the top of our deck at the
cost of losing access to our hand, an ability that is abused in two ways by
DDEFT. First is in the mechanics of Lion's Eye Diamond which becomes an actual
Black Lotus for our deck. Second is Doomsday itself, where the library stacking
and tutoring ability is effectively combined with EF's play-off-the-top clause
to allow for iterate-able wins requiring no draw spells to *crack* into the
pile.

Once an Experimental Frenzy is on board, a resolved Doomsday allows for a quick
pile with innate durability.

:::row{variant=PILE}
- LED
- LED

- TO
- DD

:::row{variant=PILE}
- LED
- LED
- LED
- ToA
- DD

Both of these generate enough mana in pile to recast Doomsday and restart the
loop, with the ToA pile being iterated as many times as necessary.
