With this chapter we want to give you a brief overview over the most relevant
matchups in the *current* meta. We try to keep everything short and easy to
read.

Every matchup is organized as follows:

- **Game plan**: a short summary of the matchup
- **Cards to keep in mind**: cards that are important for the matchups
- **Gameplay**: a longer text on how to play the pre and post Doomsday parts of
  the matchup

For reference, the document assumes a standard *Meandeck* list and should stay
generic enough that it applies to all colors.

## UR Delver

Resolving an early Doomsday is very important, but it's also important to build
fast piles.

## Jeskai Ragavan

The longer you wait, the harder it becomes to power through their card advantage
as they deploy their clock. The absence of :card[Lightning Bolt] means passing
the turn is safer than against UR Delver but the likewise, resolving Doomsday
early is best.

## Bant Miracles

Take your time. Their main clock consists of early striges and Uro which should
give you plenty of time to sculpt a hand and resolve Doomsday. Incidentally,
resolving a turn 1 Doomsday while they're unable to produce a clock fast enough
lets you protect a slow pass-the-turn pile thanks to :card[Cavern of Souls] or
countermagic in multiple. The idea is that by stacking your next 5 draws you're
supposedly drawing *better* than they will.

Beware the eventual maindeck :card[Endurance] and :card[Dress Down]!

## Death and Taxes

Slam early and build your pile around mana and card draw denial.

In longer games, they'll have access to more lock pieces and winning becomes a
real puzzle. Winning early allows you to ignore most of them as they become
relevant much later in the game. For instance resolving Doomsday on turn 1
planning a turn 2 win plays around instant-speed :card[Flickerwisp] and
:card[Skyclave Apparition]. In this case, you are giving them only one turn to
react leaving much less options for them. Suddenly, you only have to beat one
of: :card[Wasteland], :card[Rishadan Port], :card[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]
or :card[Spirit of the Labyrinth] instead of everything at once.

## Maverick

Similarly to the Death and Taxes matchup, an early Doomsday gives you enough
time to build safe piles. Avoid burying yourself under lock pieces for no good
reason.

Keep countermagic up and do not pass the turn after Doomsday without protection.

## Elves

Don't rely on countermagic, resolving an early Doomsday is a good way to win.

## Aluren

You are a lot faster and you have more protection. Don't play scared, play like
against a bad control deck.

## Reanimator

Countermagic is essential. Counter their enablers.

## UG Omni-Tell

They are just a bad control deck with a combo finish. Omni-Tell can not beat you
post Doomsday.
