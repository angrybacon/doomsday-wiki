With this chapter we want to give you a brief overview over the most relevant
matchups in the current meta. We try to keep everything short and easy to read.

To keep everything easy to read, we organized every matchup as follows:

- **Game plan**: a short summary of the matchup
- **Cards to keep in mind**: cards that are important for the matchups, divided
  in maindeck and sideboard
- **Gameplay**: a longer guide how to play the pre and post Doomsday parts of
  the matchup
