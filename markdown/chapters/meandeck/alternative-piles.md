## Table of Contents

## Preamble

In this chapter we will present some alternative piles which may be utilised
depending on the tools available in your deck. This could include spicy main
deck choices or the use of certain sideboard cards and is here to make you aware
of how some of these tools are utilised in the wild. These are not listed in any
specific order.

## Shelldock Isle Piles

You might see a lot of people running :card[SI] alongside :card[Em] in their
sideboards. The purpose of these cards is to use them in a pile that is
effective against blue-based control decks which do not run cards like
:card[Wasteland]. This pile often requires passing multiple turns and can be
used in conjunction with Oracle.

> PTT

:::row{variant=pile}
- SI
- Em
- Island
- CoS
- TO
:::

In theory you can replace Emrakul with any card (including lands) however the
uncounterable nature, the extra turn on casting (which still works with
Shelldock!) and the attack for 15 with *Annihilator 6* all make it probably the
most effective tool to use.

## Piles Using Dragon's Rage Channeler

Some people have tried various creature shells alongside the Doomsday package
and one of the more interesting ones for use as part of the Doomsday resolution
is :card[Dragon's Rage Channeler] (DRC). Each non-creature spell cast lets you
*dig* one additional card deeper through your pile thanks to the *Surveil*
ability. Let's look at a couple of examples.

> DRC in play + non-Consider castable cantrip in hand

:::row{variant=pile}
- DA
- LED
- SW
- LP
- TO
:::

The most basic example above allows you to turn any regular cantrip into a
pseudo copy of :card[Con] by giving it a *Surveil 1* effect attached. This
allows you to perform the basic Consider pile using either :card[Pnd],
:card[Pre] or :card[BS].

> {U} + DRC in play + non-Brainstorm castable cantrip in hand + X

:::row{variant=pile}
- SW
- BS
- LED
- EoA
- TO
:::

Here you can execute a Brainstorm pile even if you are at a low life total
without the use of :card[SW] or if you don't have access to tools like :card[IU]
and :card[Con]. The pile still allows you to get to 0 cards left in the deck.
Follow the listed steps:

1. Cast your cantrip and Surveil SW into the graveyard, draw BS
1. Cast BS, do not Surveil and put back TO and X
1. Cast LED, Surveil X into the graveyard
1. Cycle Edge, holding priority and cracking LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw Oracle
1. Cast Thassa's Oracle (TO) with an empty library

## Double Oracle Piles

Often you will see people running 2 :card[TO] in the maindeck or 1 main and 1 in
the side. This card naturally fits into many pre-existing piles which we have
covered already and give the option to *try and try again* when looking to beat
cards like :card[Endurance] and :card[Memory's Journey].

> PTT + {U}{U}

:::row{variant=pile}
- IU
- LP
- TO
- CoS
- TO
:::

This is a very basic take on the standard :card[IU] pile which is often used. It
can be effective in *risking* jamming a pile without putting too many cards into
the graveyard which may be returned with Endurance and also still being able to
have another Oracle in reserve if the first one doesn't work out. What is nice
is that even if they were to cast Endurance here, your library would become
(randomised past the first TO, still on top of the library) some variation of
the following:

:::row{variant=pile}
- TO
- DD
- LP
- IU
:::

As a result if they do cast an Endurance then you can pass and simply draw the
second Oracle now and try to win with a Devotion of 4 with 3 cards remaining in
your deck.

Other options include this example against a {U}{R} Delver deck which may run
:card[Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer] in.

> PTT + Cantrip + {U}

:::row{variant=pile}
- SW
- CoS
- TO
- EoA
- TO
:::

Here you might have a scenario where you want to try and win quickly but suspect
they may have a :card[Red Elemental Blast] effect. In which case you can pass,
allow Ragavan to exile SW, and try to jam the first Oracle off of Cavern
(assuming the cantrip resolves of course). If that Oracle is dealt with then you
can pass again, let Ragavan exile the :card[EoA] and try casting the second
Oracle.

## Slow Piles Using Interactive Elements

These piles have been given a generic title but they generally refer to piles
that will use tools like :card[Baleful Strix], :card[Uro, Titan of Nature's
Wrath] and :card[Teferi, Time Raveler] to act as speedbumps by blocking, gaining
life or bouncing opposing permanents whilst also drawing through the deck and
increasing your {U} Devotion.

These typically pass multiple turns and rely on having a solid manabase already
developed in play so tend to be part of the slower Doomsday variants.

> PTT + {U}{G}{1}

:::row{variant=pile}
- Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath
- Island
- Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath
- CoS
- TO
:::

Or

> PTT + {U}{B}

:::row{variant=pile}
- Baleful Strix
- EoA
- Baleful Strix
- CoS
- TO
:::

You can also combine elements to use Teferi to bounce Strix for additional card
draw and still maintain a higher {U} Devotion.

> PTT + {U}{B}

:::row{variant=pile}
- Baleful Strix
- Tundra
- Teferi, Time Raveler
- CoS
- TO
:::

## Echo of Eons piles

You can use :card[EoE] as a larger version of Ideas Unbound or Deep Analysis
which also interacts favourably with Consider. This is not a commonly used card
but if you wanted to maybe try and utilise Storm cards or perhaps run additional
LEDs then it might be useful.

In order for these piles to work and not kill you, you must ensure you have at
least one additional card available either in hand or that you can put into your
graveyard eg. a :card[LP], a Fetchland or even a land to sacrifice with
:card[EoA]. As the Echo will exile itself you cannot count that as one of your
cards.

> LED in Hand + Cantrip

:::row{variant=pile}
- Echo of Eons
- PoN
- TO
- LP
- LP
:::

In a effort to try and beat :card[Endurance] or cards like :card[Torpor Orb] and
:card[Dress Down], you can also go for a Storm pile:

> PTT, {U}{B} with BS in hand + DR in hand

:::row{variant=pile}
- Echo of Eons
- LED
- ToA
- LP
- LP
:::

The above example reaches lethal Storm count while passing the turn for minimal
initial mana cost, but piles can be simpler and include permission when you're
not forced to pass the turn since you would start at Storm count 2 thanks to the
initial Dark Ritual and Doomsday. As an exercice, try and work out the lines for
this pile.

There is a much more extensive look at Echo of Eons in the [DDFT
section][ddft:echo] of the Wiki.

## Next Steps

You don't need to have anything here memorised but do use the information
presented here as a way of looking at alternative ways. Perhaps you can build
piles with either pre-existing cards or maybe trying something a little more
off-piste.
