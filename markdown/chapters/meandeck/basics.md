## Table of Contents

## Preamble

Welcome to Chapter 0 of the Doomsday section of the Wiki.

This is the start of your journey into trying to learn a bit more about the deck
and hopefully will inspire and help you to progress further with it!

## We're Teaching People to Fish

As the Wiki front page states:

> This is specifically not a _primer_ as you often see for other decks in
> Legacy, because primers generally become outdated rather quickly and are more
> about card choices, decklists, sideboard plans, and so on. The Doomsday Wiki
> is there to help people to really understand how the deck works and can win in
> various scenarios.

As a result a lot of the information presented within these chapters is to be
taken as guidance only. The format (and the deck) changes as new cards are
printed or existing ones banned or unbanned and, with the speed with which
conversation and innovation can occur, vastly outpaces the collective authors'
ability to keep this site up to date. We try to keep things as high level and
universally applicable as possible. As a result do not seek to try and rote
memorise any _piles_ presented here but instead try and use them to ingrain core
concepts or ideas into your play which you can then supplement with experience
as you practice. There are plenty of people out there who will happily share
tables of _piles_. However, it might be worth taking a few losses early on
whilst learning the deck. While these preset piles might help you lose less at
first, reliance on them in the long run can teach you bad habits and railroad
you into suboptimal plays and _piles_.

## There are No Stupid Questions and Very Few Original Ones

Questions are good. Quizzing things helps learning and understanding. If you
don't start making inquiries into why things are as they are, then you're never
going to get the most out of any deck you play. Conversely though, a lot of the
questions you might want to ask are very likely to have been asked before. This
is great as it means it is hopefully written down somewhere already! If you
think of something you want answered and cannot find it in the chapters there
are a few places you can look which might help. First and foremost is the
[FAQs](/appendices/faq)! Otherwise, articles are dated content which are more
likely to have recent changes or information inside them.

The best place to search after the Wiki is the Doomsday Discord. Again the
search function within Discord is your best friend and especially in the
`#doomsday-discussion` channel you are likely to find the question or a similar
one having been asked before. If you genuinely can't find the answer in any of
the above sources then of course ask away (letting people know you had a good
search for it first!). There is almost always someone online to give an answer!
For non-Discord users there are a couple of other sources such as the
[/r/mtglegacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGLegacy/) or similar forums where
people sometimes ask questions.

## Practice Makes Perfect

As with anything in life there are unfortunately no shortcuts to success. The
deck is much easier than people make out however that doesn't mean you won't
lose to yourself at least once, or make small mistakes with big consequences or
forget how to navigate certain situations. This is fine, this is learning,
learning is good.

This is true for any game, format, deck that you need to put the reps in.
For many people this may be harder than it sounds. You might have family
commitments or a busy work life and thus you only really get to indulge in one
Legacy event a month. This is fine, you can work with it. Even if you only have
enough time available to read this, you can goldfish as you do. If you have five
minutes and a notepad you can theorycraft scenarios in your head and scribble
down a _pile_ to try and navigate around it. Got your decklist to hand? Make
sure you're happy with all the card choices. Justify each one to yourself. Have
the bye at a Modern FNM? Proxy up the deck and have it with you to goldfish.
Even just watching content whilst you decompress after a heavy day can help.
Have a go at pausing at key points and see if you can find a different or better
route than the creator.

Every little bit helps :)

## Have Fun

Seriously, please have fun. If you're not finding the deck fun, not enjoying the
challenge, or not feeling satisfied then don't force yourself. We won't take
offense if the deck is not to your taste. Everyone is different and so long as
you are happy in what you do that's great. (Unless you want to play Delver in
which case boooo! ... Just kidding) This is also the case with undertaking any
activity. If you are not positively benefitting from it then it may be worth
taking a step back from it for a bit.

## You Keep Saying _Pile_, What Does That Mean?

The term _pile_ is used to denote the stack of 5 cards with which you build your
deck on successfully resolving :card[Doomsday]. A large portion of this site is
to help you learn how to construct these _piles_ in order to win the game in
almost any circumstance. While it would be nigh impossible to enumerate every
game states and pile variations, these chapters are aimed to show you the basic
concepts behind casting and winning with Doomsday.

## Pile Notation

Many of the chapters will showcase a number of _piles_, their requirements and
the instructions to achieve them. For each one we shall present any mana
requirements or card requirements followed by the pile as a visual display.

If we take the following example:

> {U}{U} + Cantrip

:::row{variant=PILE}
IU
LP
LP
TO
TO
:::

The cost omits that we require {B}{B}{B} for casting Doomsday as this is an
assumed requirement for even considering what pile to build. It requires
{U}{U} for casting specific cards in the pile and the ability to _cantrip_
(draw a card). If the chosen _cantrip_ effect costs mana you will need to add
this on to the total otherwise presented. In the example of using
:card[Ponder] as your cantrip you will need {U}{U} + {U}.

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

Sometimes we will use the terminology of _X_. In this instance _X_ means having
any single card in hand, irrespective of what that card is. An _X_ card is
normally used in conjunction with :card[Brainstorm] and thus is rarely cast but
we will explore more of this in another chapter.

The instructions for executing a pile will be included below it. There may be a
paragraph or statement exploring some of the ideas within the pile but there
should also be a step by step guide in how to execute the pile too.

Let's return to the above example to see how this might be presented:

> {U}{U} + Cantrip

:::row{variant=PILE}
IU
LP
LP
TO
TO
:::

This is a simple pile that uses :card[Ideas Unbound] to draw into 2 mana and
:card[Thassa's Oracle]. It does not play around any interaction the opponent may
have.

1. Use your cantrip to draw into the pile, draw Ideas Unbound
1. Cast Ideas Unbound, draw Lotus Petal x2 and Thassa's Oracle
1. Cast both Lotus Petals and crack both for {U}
1. Cast Thassa's Oracle and win the game with 1 card left in your deck

You'll notice the term _crack_ here. _Crack_ is a colloquial term for activating
a mana rock like LED or Lotus Petal or for sacrificing a fetchland like
:card[Polluted Delta].

## Acronyms and Abbreviations

The final thing to note is we as a community really like to use acronyms or
abbreviations when talking about cards or plays. For cards, the Wiki has a
lexicon on the left hand side of each page (or accessible by clicking the menu
button on the top left for mobile devices). We may use BS as a term for
:card[Brainstorm] as an example. For other non-card based examples, if they are
related to specific chapters then they should explain them but the primary one
to note is _PTT_ which stands for _pass-the-turn_, simply implying that to
successfully execute the pile as intended, you will need to pass the turn one or
more times. Sometimes you might see people refer to a _double PTT pile_.
Hopefully as time goes on you will get used to this but again, don't feel bad
about asking if any terminology doesn't make sense to you!

## Next Steps

Hopefully you are now excited to continue learning and thus the rest of the Wiki
awaits. Remember you can always return to this chapter or any other if you need
to remind yourself of something or go back a step. That's totally fine. Just
go at your own pace! (And hopefully have fun in the process)

It is recommended you read the Wiki chapters in the order presented but feel
free to read them how you wish.
