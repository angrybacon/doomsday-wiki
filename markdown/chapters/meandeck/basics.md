The goal of all Magic decks is to win the game. {{Doomsday}} aims to do so by
casting its namesake card and constructing a *pile* of 5 cards tailored to the
current game state. While it would be nigh impossible to enumerate every game
state and pile variation, these chapters are aimed to show you the basic
concepts behind casting and winning with Doomsday. There is one primary win
condition that is used in this version of the deck to win with and that is via
{{Thassa's Oracle}}.

## Pile Construction Steps

A *pile* in this context is what we use to describe the stack of five cards that
comprise your library after the resolution of Doomsday. This is terminology that
will be used throughout the Wiki.

There are three steps that need to occur to enable you to win (at least most of
the time).  
These are as follows:

1. Resolve Doomsday
1. Draw into your pile enough so that the Oracle's trigger can win you the game
1. Resolve Thassa's Oracle

<row variant="centered">{{!DD}}{{!TO}}</row>

Of these steps, we will provide additional focus on how to achieve steps 2.
and 3. as these are the first steps that are unique to the Doomsday archetype.
Other decks like Omnitell have similar transferable skills in order to resolve a
specific key spell however it is the *pile* construction that is often the
trickiest element of playing the deck for newer players of the archetype.

<row variant="centered">{{!Pre}}{{!SW}}</row>

The first consideration to make is how you will *dig* into the pile.  
We will use the phrase *dig* to mean to initially draw into the five cards you
have stacked with Doomsday.  
The most common way to *dig* into your pile is via a *cantrip* effect. This is a
spell or ability which draws a card upon resolution. Typically this is provided
by one of the commonly played {U} filter effects like {{Preordain}} or a free
cycle effect like {{Street Wraith}}. If you are not under pressure you can also
simply pass the turn to the opposing player and use your next turn's draw step
in order to *dig* into the *pile*. When this is performed it is simply known as
a *pass the turn pile* or *PTT pile*.

Once you have decided what method you will *dig* into your pile with you need to
work out how you are going to get through enough cards that the trigger from
Thassa's Oracle will win you the game. Sometimes this means having up to two
cards left in your library on its resolution, other times it means needing to
have no cards left in your library on resolution. The former is known as an
*imperfect pile* and the latter a *perfect pile*. An *imperfect pile* is named
as such because if your opponent is able to remove the Oracle from play prior to
resolution of its trigger then you will not win the game.

## Pile Notation

In this section we will explore some of the simplest and most commonly used
piles in order to achieve a *perfect pile* for your Oracle trigger to resolve.

In each example we shall present any mana requirements or card requirements
followed by the pile as a visual display.

If we take the following example:

> {U}{U} + Cantrip

The cost omits that we require {B}{B}{B} for casting Doomsday as this is an
assumed requirement for even considering what pile to build. It requires {U}{U}
for casting specific cards in the pile and the ability to *cantrip*. If the
chosen *cantrip* effect costs mana you will need to add this on to the total
otherwise presented. In the example of using Preordain as your cantrip you will
need {U}{U} + {U}.

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

Sometimes we will use the terminology of X. In this instance X means having any
single card in hand, irrespective of what that card is. An X card is normally
used in conjunction with {{Brainstorm}} and thus is rarely cast but we will
explore more of this in another chapter.

## Single Cantrip + Ideas Unbound Pile

> {U}{U} + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

Here you can use a cantrip to access the {{Ideas Unbound}}. This allows you to
draw the two {{Lotus Petal}}s and the cycle effect. You can then cycle to draw
the Oracle and cast it using the two Petals. Because this pile does not make use
of {{Lion's Eye Diamond}} you can hold up cards like {{Force of Will}} or
{{Daze}} in order to protect it. You can also substitute Street Wraith for
{{Edge of Autumn}} if you are low on life or a Lotus Petal for a {{Cavern of
Souls}} if you have a land drop available to you.

## Single Cantrip + Predict Pile

> {1}{U} + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!Pdt}} {{!Pnd}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

This is a slightly different take for people who wish to use {{Predict}} over
Ideas Unbound. In this example you use your cantrip effect to draw Predict. You
cast Predict to name the top card of your deck, in this example {{Ponder}},
drawing the cycle effect and Lion's Eye Diamond (LED). You cast the LED. You
then cycle, hold priority, and *crack* the LED for {U}{U}{U}.

*Crack is a colloquial term for activating a mana rock like LED or Lotus Petal
(LP) or for sacrificing a Fetchland like {{Polluted Delta}}.*

Once the cycle draw resolves, you will now have the mana to cast Oracle.

## Double Cantrip Pile

> Cantrip + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!PoN}} {{!TO}}</row>

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!Pdt}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

If you find yourself constrained on the mana to cast both a cantrip, and one of
your two mana draw spells but have an additional, useable cantrip in hand then
you can construct what is known as a *double cantrip* pile. You use the first
cantrip to draw the LED. Cast it and in response to the second cantrip, *crack*
the LED for {U}{U}{U}. This will then allow you to draw into the two mana draw
spell and cast it to draw into Oracle and the LP required for the second {U}.

In one of those examples above we have included a suggestion where you can
include protection slots within the pile. If you have the available mana it may
help you against opponents who are either trying to slow roll their permission
spells or who are holding something like {{Stifle}} up.

## Piles Not Using Predict nor Ideas Unbound

In the event that your draw spell(s) gets exiled, usually by pitching them to
Force of Will or through your opponent actions, you need another way of drawing
into your pile. With enough initial mana, regular cantrips and cyclers will do
just fine.

If short on mana and LED becomes necessary, you can replicate the *double
cantrip* piles above once again using the first cantrip to draw into LED, and
the second cantrip to dig deeper into your pile while cracking the LED for mana.

> Cantrip + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}} {{!TO}}</row>

The above pile is pretty simplistic but shows that sometimes the simplest route
is the most effective one. With additional cantrips you can even include
protection slots within the pile.

For any of the above examples you can reduce the cost drastically by using the
free cyclers Street Wraith and/or Edge of Autumn. There are also some
interesting tricks we can utilise where the card {{Brainstorm}} is one of the
cantrips within our hand however we will cover those in another chapter.

## Passing the Turn

As previously mentioned, a *pass the turn pile* or *PTT pile* is simply one
where, instead of having a cantrip to draw into the pile in hand, you utilise
your draw for the turn instead. There are many reasons why passing the turn
might be advantageous or necessary based on the resources available to you.

Take the following example:

> 7 Card opening hand  
> Game 1  
> On the play

<row variant="hand">{{!DR}} {{!DD}} {{!FoW}} {{!FoW}} {{!S|RAV}} {{!I|RAV}} {{!Pre}}</row>

Here we have a great example of what looks to be a *combo ready hand* however we
cannot actually go off in the same turn with it. Even if we were to wait one
more turn we still wouldn't have the guaranteed win unless we draw well and our
opponent could play some interactive piece that punishes us for waiting.

Given we have some protection in hand already, it is probably best to *jam* DR
into DD off of the Swamp and build something like what we have already seen in
the examples above:

> PTT

<row variant="pile">{{!Pdt}} {{!SW}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}}</row>

Or

> PTT + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!Tsz}} {{!TO}}</row>

The first example is a *Single cantrip + Predict* example and the second is a
*Double Cantrip* example which also allows you to hold up {B} from your swamp to
cast a Thoughtseize before committing Oracle to the stack. In this second
example one of the cantrips involved is your draw step.

If you are concerned about additional permission from the opponent you could
even consider passing the turn again if you don't feel under pressure. Instead
of using LED you can set up something like this:

> PTT + PTT

<row variant="pile">{{!Pdt}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!Pnd}} {{!TO}}</row>

In this example you can draw Predict for turn, play your island and pass again.
At the end of the opponent's turn you can then cast the Predict, targeting
yourself and naming Street Wraith, to draw LP and Ponder. This then allows you
to draw Oracle for your turn and cast it off of Island and LP with double Force
of Will backup (with Preordain/Ponder as your *pitch* cards). You even have an
additional {B} available to pay for something like Daze. In the event of trouble
prior to the Predict, or to protect the Predict itself, you have the first Force
of Will available.
