## Preamble

It is very often the case that you are able to resolve Doomsday but, due to
constraints on resources (either after pitching cards to a counter war or as a
result of being able to cast it so early and being constrained on mana), you
cannot immediately execute a pile. In these circumstances we would elect to use
what is colloquially known as a _pass-the-turn_ pile or _PTT_ pile.

As previously mentioned, a _pass-the-turn_ pile or _PTT_ pile is simply one
where, instead of having a cantrip to draw into the pile in hand, you utilise
your draw for the turn instead. There are many reasons why passing the turn
might be advantageous or necessary based on the resources available to you.
There are also many scenarios where passing the turn multiple times is correct
sometimes even up to the full 5 allowed before you are in danger of decking out.

In almost any given scenario, unless under a _do or die_ situation, you should
be able to accrue more resources and have the luxury of time if needed so do try
to think about the lessons in this chapter especially hard.

This chapter will look at examples where you might wish to pass the turn and the
types of pile you could build in these circumstances. It will also revisit some
concepts in previous chapters and show examples where you might build a pile
which can pivot to win faster or slower depending on how the circumstances might
change after passing the turn. Please do remember however that all of these are
just examples and that you shouldn't look to any of them as _objectively
correct_ for the situations presented.

## Pass-the-Turn Piles

Almost all of the examples presented in the previous chapters can be executed as
a PTT pile simply by replacing one or more of the cantrip requirements in their
cost with passing the turn for each instance. Depending on how you initially
cast Doomsday this also can enable additional resources (for example +1 mana) to
incorporate more defensive elements into the piles. It will also provide you
with a land drop often allowing the use of :card[CoS] instead of a Lotus Petal.
Let's look at a scenario where we might want to build a PTT pile.

Take the following example:

> 7 cards opening hand  
> Game 1  
> On the play

:::row
DR
DD
FoW
FoW
Underground Sea
Island
Pnd
:::

Here we have a great example of what looks to be a _combo ready_ hand however we
cannot actually go off in the same turn with it. Even if we were to wait one
more turn we still wouldn't have the guaranteed win and our opponent could very
well play some interactive piece that punishes us for waiting.

Given we have some protection in hand already, it is probably best to _jam_ DR
into DD off of the Sea and build something like what we have already seen in
previous chapters:

> PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
IU
LP
LP
SW
TO
:::

This first example above assumes that we are able to untap and play our Island
thus having {U}{U} to cast Ideas Unbound. Assuming this is the case we can
simply execute the Ideas pile and cast Oracle with Force of Will protection. It
follows the same execution steps as presented in the [Simple
Piles](/meandeck/simple-piles) chapter.

> PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
SW
TO
EoA
TO
:::

This second example takes some inspiration from the 4 cyclers pile with some
minor modifications. Assuming you are playing 2 Oracles, you can build this,
passing the turn. Draw the first SW for turn. Play your Island and cycle through
to the first Oracle and cast it. If they have an answer you can try to Force it.
If they do manage to kill or counter the Oracle you can simply pass again and
cycle Edge into the second Oracle to try and win for a second time.

This is a good example that showcases how a lot of piles can be built thinking
ahead to multiple scenarios and being designed to be able to pivot depending on
what happens in the opponent's turn.

## Piles with Multiple Lines

Going back to the first example presented above, the pile assumes you will be
able to have access to {U}{U} on your turn 2 and that Ideas Unbound can and will
resolve. Legacy as a format though is not so forgiving and there are numerous
ways that your opponents can prevent you from executing the pile as desired.

If we were to look at the pile presented and have cast DR, DD from Underground
Sea we are left with the following cards in hand:

:::row
FoW
FoW
Island
Pnd
:::

These are all tools we should think about when building the pile we want to
construct. If we think about the pile built in that first example, it does not
really take into account any of the other cards we have barring the Island (to
cast IU) and maybe the Forces (to protect the Oracle).

> PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
IU
LP
LP
SW
TO
:::

Now let's look at this pile through a series of _what if_ scenarios and see how
it stacks up. If the opponent gets rid of our Land through :card[Wasteland] or
:card[Rishadan Port], we are suddenly left with no option but to pass the turn
another 2-3 times to access our Oracle and by that time our opponent has had a
lot of time to find more answers or apply pressure against our halved life
total. Likewise if they have :card[Daze] for our Ideas Unbound, are we willing
to risk Forcing it to then have the Oracle countered later in the turn? If not
then we have to get a little more creative.

One thing we can do when building the pile is rearrange it slightly to
facilitate the potential for needing a _plan B_. Let's look at the same pile but
in a slightly different order:

> PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
IU
SW
TO
LP
LP
:::

All the cards are the same here and you can still execute it in the same fashion
as before but this order gives access to Oracle a lot faster if needed. If they
Daze the Ideas, we can simply play our Island and pass, (or play Island, Ponder
and pass) to then try again next turn. Maybe you suspect they have multiple
Force effects or a Force effect and Endurance? You can always pass the turn.
Draw IU, play Island and pass again. Then draw SW, cycle into TO and play it
with double Force of Will available now.

Maybe they cast a :card[Spirit of the Labyrinth] off of Cavern of Souls and
Chrome Mox. Suddenly Your Ideas is useless and Ponder can't help. Having the SW
means you can pass twice, cycle SW in their turn and then try to play TO with
double Force of Will (pitching Ponder and IU) and even have access to one of the
Petals in case they have removed one of your lands.

Some of these situations are very unlikely to occur but in any game there is the
possibility that things will change quickly and it's good practice to try and
run through some of these scenarios when building your pile.

## Piles with Brainstorm

Brainstorm is one of the most powerful tools in enabling a change in tempo of
how fast you execute a pile. Assuming you have the cards in hand, you are able
to access the Oracle much quicker than you normally might which can be very
advantageous against certain decks, especially if they suddenly go _shields
down_ in terms of presenting removal or other similar punishers to an imperfect
pile.

Let's revisit the scenario at the start of this chapter but change the cantrip
we had in hand from Ponder to Brainstorm.

> 7 cards opening hand  
> Game 1  
> On the play

:::row
DR
DD
FoW
FoW
Underground Sea
Island
BS
:::

Now that we have Brainstorm available we can easily pass the turn only once and,
assuming no countermagic, we are able to decide whether to slow or fast pile
here. As we are on the play in game 1 against an unknown deck it is risky to
assume any resources we shall have so we should build something with flexibility
and protection in it.

Let us think about something like this:

> PTT + PTT + BS

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
SW
CoS
TO
LP
:::

1. Resolve Doomsday, Pass the Turn
1. Draw SW for turn.
1. Play Island, Pass the Turn, BS in their end step, draw SW, CoS, TO, put back
   CoS, TO
1. Draw TO for turn.
1. Cycle SW, draw CoS
1. Cycle SW, draw LP
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Play CoS, name Merfolk or Wizard
1. Cast an uncounterable Oracle with 0 cards left in your deck.

If we wanted to slow pile we could follow the above sequence with Force of Will
backup for any surprises. The use of Brainstorm here is merely as a cantrip to
enable us to dig one card deeper. This is a pretty resilient pile that helps
beat removal, counter-magic and 1 additional threat. We can however speed it up
if need be thanks to Brainstorm.

Say we are against a deck like Moon Stompy and they spend their turn playing
:card[Caves of Chaos Adventurer]. We know they don't have any removal or
countermagic so we decide we want to go now. We can change the speed with which
we execute the pile as such:

> PTT + BS

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
SW
CoS
TO
LP
:::

1. Resolve Doomsday, Pass the Turn
1. Draw SW for turn.
1. Cycle SW, draw SW
1. Cast BS, draw CoS, TO, LP, put back FoW and FoW or SW
1. Play LP, crack for {U}
1. Play CoS, name Merfolk or Wizard
1. Cast an uncounterable Oracle with 2 cards left in your deck.

There are many other scenarios or matchups where you might wish to slow pile but
then change your mind or likewise build a faster PTT pile but then decide to
wait. There is no right or wrong way to go about this as it is very context
dependant but Brainstorm is a very effective tool in giving you the flexibility
to do so.

## Piles with Fetchlands

Fetchlands are a great way to slow pile and provide both access to additional
mana and a reduction in turns needing to be passed. They also cost less life
than a SW cycle.

> PTT + PTT + PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
Polluted Delta
Flooded Strand
TO
Island
Underground Sea
:::

This is a very clean pile if you get a very early Doomsday and expect to have
your mana denied. It does require you to pass the turn three times but does keep
you reasonably insulated versus Wasteland and Port effects.

You can combine this concept with the use of Brainstorm, especially if you have
a land already in hand. Once again returning to our scenario for the chapter:

> 7 cards opening hand  
> Game 1  
> On the play

:::row
DR
DD
FoW
FoW
Underground Sea
Island
BS
:::

We could build something that instead of playing the Island straight off,
incorporates a fetchland to make use of the Brainstorm in order to _swap_ it
into the pile.

Think of something like this:

> PTT + BS

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
Polluted Delta
LP
TO
CoS
:::

1. Resolve Doomsday, Pass the Turn
1. Draw SW for turn.
1. Cycle SW, draw Polluted Delta
1. Cast BS, draw LP, TO, CoS, put back CoS and Island
1. Play LP, crack for {U}
1. Play Delta, crack to fetch Island
1. Cast Oracle with 1 card left in your deck.

This variation allows us to resolve Oracle and still hold up Force of Will
(assuming our initial Sea stays in place). Useful for non-{U} decks than might
be representing removal. Again if they do take out the land we can play the
Island anyways and just have the Delta as an extra card to put back with a BS if
we wish to cast it.

## Piles with Protection

Sometimes you might cast an early Doomsday with a cycle effect in hand but no
protection. If you have a spare {U} card you can always stack a Force of Will or
similar on top to act as a _safety net_ if needed. This is a pretty handy way to
ensure you can progress the pile unihibited and is especially useful if you
otherwise would have a guaranteed (if unprotected) kill next turn. Likewise you
can incorporate all manner of discard spells or countermagic as required if the
situation allows.

## Next Steps

We've been thinking about some scenarios which have potential interaction from
the opponent but a lot of our pile examples have been without protection other
than Cavern of Souls. Next we'll start to think more about how we can play
around what our opponent might have a bit more.
