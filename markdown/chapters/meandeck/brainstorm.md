title: Brainstorm in Doomsday
---

*Preface: We will be using terminology and abbreviations introduced in the
Basics chapter of the wiki. If you have not read the Basics chapter it is
recommended you do so first as this builds upon the concepts introduced there.*

Brainstorm is one of the most powerful spells available in the Legacy format at
this time. There have been numerous articles written on this *seemingly
innocuous at first glance* one mana cantrip. We'll assume you know the basics of
casting Brainstorm, and instead focus on the specifics of using it as a part of,
or to initiate, your doomsday piles. In many cases it can be used as any other
cantrip, but it has unique applications to Doomsday piles by allowing you to
swap cards in hand for cards in the pile.

In the basics we alluded to the use of Brainstorm as being a special case when
discussing the use of cantrips to dig into our Doomsday piles. More than just a
cantrip to start consuming your piles, Brainstorm can enable you to access three
cards at once from said pile unlike other options from your suite of cantrips
which only allow access to one. This, combined with what could be otherwise
*dead* cards from hand can turn a resource light turn into a winning one.

Brainstorm piles allow you to win with limited initial mana resources. For
example; if you are constrained on mana against Wasteland or opposing Rishadan
Port activations you can still combo out with only a Brainstorm post-Doomsday as
long as you have at least one extra card in hand to put back. Sometimes it can
be difficult to identify when you have access to a Brainstorm pile, or when your
Brainstorm is better off simply as the second cantrip in a Double Cantrip pile.
With this guide, and some practice, you should become confident in this decision
making in no time.

## Brainstorm Pile - Brainstorm Available

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

Here we have the simplest type of Brainstorm pile. Instead of needing both a
cantrip effect and {U}{U}, we can convert the Brainstorm into what is missing.
In the worked example above, you effectively turn the Brainstorm and the
superfluous card into {U}{U}{U} plus a way to draw into your two mana draw
spell, in this instance Ideas Unbound.

Let's look at the steps to complete the pile:

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Ideas Unbound (IU) on top
1. Cast LED, cycle Street Wraith (SW) cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the IU
1. Cast IU, drawing the rest of the pile
1. The Lotus Petal gives you a second {U} to cast Thassa's Oracle (TO) with an
   empty library

Another example is presented here using Predict.

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pdt}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Predict on top
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Predict
1. Target yourself with Predict naming X and drawing the rest of the pile
1. The Lotus Petal gives you a second {U} to cast TO with an empty library

Both of the worked examples above allow for perfect piles to be made, allowing
you to play around removal like :card[Swords to Plowshares].

## Brainstorm Pile - Brainstorm and *Combo Piece* Available

You may find yourself in a scenario where you have a card in hand that is
considered *dead* outside of the combo turn. Thankfully, Brainstorm (BS) allows
you to transfer it out of your hand and replace it into the pile. Let us
consider the example above. It may be the opponent has a card like :card[Scavenging
Ooze] out and you need to utilize LED to generate mana but don't want to
discard your one Oracle to have it *eaten* by the Ooze. We cannot use Predict
here as we would need to *mill* the Oracle to do so effectively. In many
situations you might be able to make a PTT pile however if your life total is
under pressure you may not be able to.

Consider the following example:

> {U} + Brainstorm + Thassa's Oracle

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pnd}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back Oracle then Ponder on top.
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Ponder.
1. Cast Ponder and arrange your library so that it is (EoA, TO, Pnd)
1. Draw Edge, cycle Edge, draw Ponder then Oracle.
1. Cast Oracle to win.

As you can see this is an imperfect pile as it does not beat removal on Oracle
due to it leaving a single card in your deck. If you have an additional {U}
available then you can change step 3. above to arrange the deck (EoA, Pnd, TO)
and cast the second Ponder with the additional {U}. Likewise, if you have
another Preordain or Ponder in addition to the Oracle in hand, you can use that
instead of the first Ponder in the example and use that extra card to generate
the additional {U} needed for the same starting mana cost.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Thassa's Oracle + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back Oracle then your Cantrip on top.
1. Cast LED and LP, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Cantrip.
1. Cast the Cantrip and arrange your library so that it is (EoA, Pnd, TO)
1. Draw Edge, cycle Edge and draw Oracle.
1. Cast Oracle to win.

The Cantrip in the above example can be any of Ponder, Preordain or Brainstorm.
Depending on which cantrip you use changes how you perform step 3 above. If it
is Ponder, you simply rearrange the deck as there are only 3 cards left in it
during resolution. Likewise, with Brainstorm; you will draw all three cards and
replace 2 in the desired order as required. With Preordain you scry the Oracle
to the bottom of your library and draw the next card along. Another free cycler
will not work in this position as they do not have the deck manipulation effects
needed however even something as simple as Opt can be used.

Even if not the Oracle, if you already have another element of the pile in hand,
you can substitute additional toolbox cards within the *standard* pile to
utilise the additional resources. Let's look at an example where you have an
extra {B} available, IU in hand and you know your opponent is holding a Stifle
in hand.

> {U}{B} + Brainstorm + Ideas Unbound + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Tsz}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

We can play the pile in the following manner:

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Ideas Unbound (IU) on top
1. Cast Thoughtseize targeting the opponent and taking their Stifle
1. Cast LED, cycle Street Wraith (SW) cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the IU
1. Cast IU, drawing the rest of the pile
1. The Lotus Petal gives you a second {U} to cast Thassa's Oracle (TO) with an
   empty library

Because we had additional resources we were able to utilise them to provide
additional protection against what our opponent had. In this instance having the
extra card in hand allowed us to make use of three of the pile cards immediately
rather than just two. This also results in a perfect pile.

## Brainstorm Pile - Brainstorm and *Free Cantrip* Available

You may find yourself with all the tools in hand to perform a Brainstorm pile,
but you don't have a spare {U} this time to cast the Brainstorm itself. If you
have any free cycling effect in hand you can get around this by placing a Lotus
Petal as the first card of your pile. This works with a {U}-producing land as
well if you have an available land drop for that turn.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!I|RAV}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back X then TO
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the TO
1. Cast TO with the remaining mana from LED with two cards left in your library

Again this is an example of an imperfect pile. If you played a list featuring
:card[Consider] in, you can make the following minor adjustment to the pile to turn
it into a perfect pile.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!Consider}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back X then Consider
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Consider
1. Cast Consider, put X into the graveyard and draw TO
1. Cast TO with the remaining mana from LED with zero cards left in your library

## Brainstorm Pile - {U} and *Free Cantrip* Available

Using the concepts we learned above, we can actually create an imperfect
Brainstorm pile without Brainstorm even being in our hand. Instead of needing
something like a Lotus Petal to be our top card, we can set Brainstorm as our
top card instead.

> {U} + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!BS}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!Island|RAV}}</row>

This time you cycle into the Brainstorm rather than into the mana needed for it
and make an imperfect pile. Once again, you can use excess mana or add mana in
the pile if the card X is a cantrip in order to make it a perfect pile.

Alternatively, use Consider to get rid of X and achieve a perfect pile.

> {U} + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!BS}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!Consider}} {{!TO}}</row>

## Brainstorm Pile - Not using LED

Sometimes you may not wish to commit to a Brainstorm pile because you are
concerned about interaction and are holding Force of Will and a *pitch* card for
it. In these circumstances you can often create an imperfect Brainstorm pile to
win that same turn whilst keeping up your countermagic. Let us consider the
following scenario:

You successfully resolve Doomsday but suspect your opponent may be holding an
:card[Endurance] plus *pitch* card in hand. In this scenario you can build the
following pile:

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X + X

<row variant="pile">{{!EoA}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the Edge of Autumn (EoA)
1. Cycle EoA, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back X then X
1. Cast both LP, crack them for {U}{U}
1. Cast TO with two cards left in your library

Here we successfully perform an imperfect Brainstorm pile without needing to
discard our hand to LED.

You can also utilise a spare land in hand plus a land drop to enable the
creation of a perfect Brainstorm pile. Consider the following scenario where we
have perhaps run out of fetchable lands from our deck as they are in our hand:

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + Underground Sea + Underground Sea  
> A fetchland in play, land drop available for turn

<row variant="pile">{{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!Misty Rainforest}} {{!Daze}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw SW
1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back both Underground Seas
1. Play Misty Rainforest, crack both fetchlands
1. Tap both Seas for {U}
1. Cast TO with zero cards left in your library

## Brainstorm Pile - Speeding up a PTT Pile

Sometimes you might not be able to execute an imperfect Brainstorm pile due to
known removal and so elect to build a pass the turn pile instead. You may have
the Brainstorm in hand but elect to build a slower pile relying on cycle effects
and fetch lands. If, for whatever reason, circumstances in the game state
change, you can use the Brainstorm to dig into the pile quicker to access what
you need to win on the spot.

Let us consider the following example:

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

<row variant="pile">{{!SW}} {{!SW}} {{!CoS}} {{!TO}} {{!PoN}}</row>

You can speed things up with this pile if your opponent does something like tap
out of mana from their Swords to Plowshares. On their end step you can do the
following:

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Cavern of Souls
1. Draw Cavern of Souls for the turn
1. Cycle SW, draw X
1. Cycle SW, draw TO
1. Play Cavern, name Wizard, cast TO with one card left in your library

This is one example of many possible scenarios you can use Brainstorm in a pile
in order to give flexibility on how it can be played out.

## Next Steps

Now you have covered the basic concepts of pile building and the use of
Brainstorm to exchange resources between hand and the pile itself, the next
stage is to start considering the interactions that can occur with an opponent
trying to prevent you from resolving Doomsday itself or any of the cards within
a given pile.

Don't forget you can revisit this section at any time if you feel like you need
to refresh yourself on any concepts presented.
