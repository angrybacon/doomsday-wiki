## Preamble

:card[Brainstorm] is one of the most powerful spells available in the Legacy
format at this time. There have been numerous articles written on this
_seemingly innocuous at first glance_ one mana cantrip. We'll assume you know
the basics of casting Brainstorm, and instead focus on the specifics of using it
as a part of &mdash; or to initiate &mdash; your Doomsday piles. In many cases
it can be used as any other cantrip, but it has unique applications to Doomsday
piles by allowing you to swap cards in hand for cards in the pile.

In the core concepts we alluded to the use of Brainstorm as being a special case
when discussing the use of cantrips to dig into our Doomsday piles. More than
just a cantrip to start consuming your piles, Brainstorm can enable you to
access three cards at once from said pile unlike other options from your suite
of cantrips. This, combined with what could be otherwise _dead_ cards from hand
can turn a resource-light turn into a winning one.

Brainstorm piles allow you to win with very limited initial mana resources. For
example, if you are constrained on mana against :card[Wasteland] or opposing
:card[Rishadan Port] activations you can still combo out with only a Brainstorm
post-Doomsday as long as you have at least one extra card in hand to put back.
Sometimes it can be difficult to identify when you have access to a Brainstorm
pile, or when your Brainstorm is better off simply as the second cantrip in a
Double Cantrip pile. With this guide, and some practice, you should become
confident in this decision making in no time.

_Also to note: we'll start to use more acronyms and abbreviations in this
chapter_

## Brainstorm in Hand

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
SW
IU
LP
TO
:::

Here we have the simplest type of Brainstorm pile. Instead of needing both a
cantrip effect and {U}{U}, we can convert the Brainstorm into what is missing.

Let's look at the steps to complete the pile:

1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, IU and put back X then IU on top
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw IU
1. Cast IU, draw X, LP and TO
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast TO and win the game with 0 cards left in your deck

In the worked example above, you effectively turn the Brainstorm and the
superfluous card into {U}{U}{U} plus a way to draw into your two mana draw
spell, in this instance Ideas Unbound.

Another example is presented here using other cantrips.

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
SW
Pnd
TO
Island
:::

1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, Pnd and put back X then Pnd on top
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw Pnd
1. Cast Pnd, draw TO
1. Cast TO and win the game with 2 cards left in your deck

The Island in the example can be any card as it is not used in the execution of
the pile. You can use Consider to turn this second example from an _imperfect
pile_ to a _perfect_ one.

> {U} + Brainstorm + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
SW
Con
SW
TO
:::

1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, Con and put back X then Con on top
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw Consider
1. Cast Consider, surveil X, draw SW
1. Cycle SW, draw TO
1. Cast TO and win the game with 0 cards left in your deck

As always you can play around with the compositions of these piles depending on
what X is in your hand.

## Brainstorm and Combo Piece Available

You may find yourself in a scenario where you have a card in hand that is
thought to be _dead_ outside of the combo turn. Thankfully, Brainstorm allows
you to transfer it out of your hand and replace it into the pile. Let's take the
example above. It may be the opponent has a card like :card[Scavenging Ooze] out
and you need to utilize LED to generate mana but don't want to discard your one
Oracle to have it _eaten_ by the Ooze.

Take the following example:

> {U} + Brainstorm + Thassa's Oracle

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
SW
Pnd
EoA
Pnd
:::

1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, Pnd, put back Oracle then Pnd on top.
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw Pnd.
1. Cast Ponder and arrange your library so that it is (Top - EoA, TO, Pnd -
   Bottom), draw EoA
1. Cycle EoA and draw TO.
1. Cast TO and win the game with 1 card left in your deck

As you can see this is an imperfect pile as it does not beat removal on Oracle
due to it leaving a single card in your deck. If you have an additional {U}
available then you can change step 3. above to arrange the deck (EoA, Pnd, TO)
and cast the second Ponder with the additional {U}. Likewise, if you have
another Ponder or Preordain in addition to the Oracle in hand, you can use that
instead of the first Ponder in the example and use that extra card to generate
the additional {U} needed for the same starting mana cost.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Thassa's Oracle + Cantrip

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
SW
LP
EoA
Pnd
:::

1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, LP, put back Oracle then your Cantrip on top
1. Cast LED and LP
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED and LP for {U}{U}{U}{U}, draw the Cantrip
1. Cast the Cantrip and arrange your library as (EoA, Pnd, TO), draw EoA
1. Cycle Edge, draw Ponder
1. Cast Ponder, draw Oracle
1. Cast Oracle to win with 0 cards left in your deck

The Cantrip in the above example can be any of Ponder, Preordain or Brainstorm.
Depending on which cantrip you use changes how you perform step 3 above. If it
is Ponder, you simply rearrange the deck as there are only 3 cards left in it
during resolution. Likewise, with Brainstorm; you will draw all three cards and
replace 2 in the desired order as required. With Preordain you scry the Oracle
to the bottom of your library and draw the next card along. Another free cycler
will not work in this position as they do not have the deck manipulation effects
needed however even something as simple as :card[Opt] can be used.

Even if not the Oracle, if you already have another element of the pile in hand,
you can substitute additional toolbox cards within the _standard_ pile to
utilise the additional resources. Let's look at an example where you have an
extra {B} available, :card[IU] in hand and you know your opponent is holding a
:card[Stifle] in hand.

> {U}{B} + Brainstorm + Ideas Unbound + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
SW
Dur
LP
TO
:::

We can play the pile in the following manner:

1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, Duress, put back X then Ideas Unbound on top
1. Cast Duress targeting the opponent, take their Stifle
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw IU
1. Cast IU, draw X, LP, TO
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast Oracle to win with 0 cards in your deck

Because we had additional resources we were able to utilise them to provide
additional protection against what our opponent had. In this instance having the
extra card in hand allowed us to make use of three of the pile cards immediately
rather than just two. This also results in a perfect pile.

## Brainstorm and Free Cantrip Available

You may find yourself with all the tools in hand to perform a Brainstorm pile,
but you don't have a spare {U} this time to cast the Brainstorm itself. If you
have any free cycle effect in hand you can get around this by placing a Lotus
Petal as the first card of your pile. This works with a {U}-producing land as
well if you have an available land drop for that turn.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
LP
LED
EoA
TO
Island | RAV
:::

1. Cycle SW, draw LP
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, EoA, TO, put back X then TO on top
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle EoA, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw TO
1. Cast Oracle and win the game with 2 cards in your deck

Again this is an example of an _imperfect pile_. If you played a list featuring
:card[Consider] in, you can make the following minor adjustment to the pile to
turn it into a _perfect pile_.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
LP
LED
EoA
Consider
TO
:::

1. Cycle SW, draw LP
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, EoA, Consider, put back X then Consider on top
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle EoA, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw Consider
1. Cast Consider, surveil X, draw TO
1. Cast Oracle and win the game with 0 cards in your deck

## Free Cantrip Available

Using the concepts we learned above, we can actually create an imperfect
Brainstorm pile without Brainstorm even being in our hand. Instead of needing
something like a Lotus Petal to be our top card, we can set Brainstorm as our
top card instead.

> {U} + Street Wraith + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
LED
EoA
TO
Island | RAV
:::

This time you cycle into the Brainstorm rather than into the mana needed for it
and make an imperfect pile. Once again, you can use excess mana or add mana in
the pile if the card X is a cantrip in order to make it a perfect pile.

Alternatively, use Consider to get rid of X and achieve a perfect pile.

> {U} + Street Wraith + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
LED
EoA
Consider
TO
:::

## Not Using LED

Sometimes you may not wish to commit to a Brainstorm pile because you are
concerned about interaction and are holding Force of Will and a _pitch_ card for
it. In these circumstances you can often create an imperfect Brainstorm pile to
win that same turn whilst keeping up your countermagic.

For instance, you successfully resolved Doomsday but suspect your opponent may
be holding an :card[Endurance] in hand. In this scenario you can build the
following pile:

> Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
EoA
LP
LP
LP
TO
:::

1. Cycle SW, draw EoA
1. Cycle EoA, draw LP
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast Brainstorm, draw LP, LP, TO, put back both Xs on top
1. Cast both LP, crack them for {U}{U}
1. Cast TO to win with 2 cards left in your deck

Here we successfully perform an imperfect Brainstorm pile without needing to
discard our hand to LED.

You can also utilise a spare land in hand plus a land drop to enable a perfect
Brainstorm pile. Take the following scenario where we have perhaps run out of
fetchable lands from our deck as they are in our hand:

> Brainstorm + Street Wraith + Underground Sea + Underground Sea
>
> A fetchland in play and a land drop available for turn

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
LP
Misty Rainforest
Daze
TO
:::

1. Cycle SW, draw SW
1. Cycle SW, draw LP
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast Brainstorm. draw Misty, Daze, TO, put back both Underground Seas
1. Play Misty Rainforest, crack both fetchlands
1. Tap both Seas for {U}
1. Cast TO with 0 cards left in your library

## Next Steps

_One final point to make is to be careful in the use of Brainstorm. When
resolving, it requires you to draw 3 cards at once which can be painful if you
are hit by an opposing mill effect in response. Sometimes a Brainstorm can get
stranded in your hand or pile without use._

Now you have covered the basic concepts of pile building and the use of
Brainstorm to exchange resources between hand and the pile itself. The next
stage starts looking more at passing the turn, sometimes multiple times, to
execute a pile.
