## Get Started

Now that you've read up on the theory of how to build piles, how to play around
opponents and how to put your deck together it is time to start putting it all
into practice. This chapter will help you start out by trying to present some
tricky real world scenarios and possible ways to play through them as well as
give some ideas as to what you can do to prepare for playing.

## Choosing a Deck List

The first step to being able to practice with the deck is to first obtain a deck
list. Even following the precepts in the [Deck
Construction](/meandeck/deck-construction) chapter, this is very hard to do in
isolation so it's a good idea to find some inspiration first. There are plenty
of sites online that publish league lists, high tournament finishes and so on.
There is also the very active Discord community, many who are happy to share
their current lists and their thoughts and feelings on them.

Sometimes the metagame will dictate a favourite in the various styles of the
deck but a lot of the time there will be no _best list_ to run. Simply a large
variety of ways you could construct your 75 cards.

### Adapting Online Lists

Once you've found a list you like the look of, it's time for some tuning. Maybe
you saw something top 8 a Sunday Challenge or perhaps you really liked a brew
mentioned in a video. Whatever it is, get your deck-building tool of choice and
start iterating it to your own tastes.

This doesn't mean you have to make changes to any list you start from but it
does mean you should really think about each and every slot within it and
justify to yourself either 1. Why it is worth running or 2. If you would prefer
to run something else in its place. Maybe the author of the list made some
footnotes or is happy to converse on their thoughts? Even so you should just
look it over anyways. It is preferable to scrutinise any deck you find online
and try to really understand it.

Some questions you could be asking yourself:

- What turn does it want to cast Doomsday?
- Is it suitable for your target meta?
- Does it fit your playstyle?
- What cards does it not play and why?

Even if you arrive at the same point as the original list, you will now have a
greater understanding of how it is constructed.

### Testing Flex Slots

There are a lot of flex slots within Doomsday decks. Sometimes these have low
impact or play differential (switching a 4th Lotus Petal for a 3rd Cabal Ritual)
whilst other times they can have significant effects on how you are able play
(running Consider or not). If you are unsure about any slots, especially
singleton _pile cards_, one good method is to strip your list right back to not
have any of the _pile cards_ and just playtest some scenarios (using a generic
replacement for those cards like Street Wraiths or Preordains). Goldfishing
&mdash; as will be discussed later &mdash; with these limitations will help you
identify, at least to start with, what tools you feel you truly need and which
you are happy to be without.

## Methods of Practice

Once you have a decklist drafted (remember, it can always be changed later!), it
is time to get practicing with it. There are a couple of ways you can do this.
Some will require more time than others and, as everyone's lifestyles are
different, this means some will be more suited to you than others. That's
totally fine.

### Goldfishing

One of the classic ways of practicing, especially for combo decks. The term
_goldfishing_ (or playing against a goldfish) is the practice of playing without
an opponent by drawing a starting hand and proceeding to continue to play until
an opponent who does nothing to stop you from accomplishing the gameplan is
defeated. In this instance by succesfully executing plan A of casting and
resolving Doomsday and a Doomsday pile.

This method is really good for evaluating your mulligan decisions and to
identify the natural speed of your deck. If you find you are not able to put
Doomsday on the stack quickly enough, maybe you need to think about being more
aggressive in your mulligans? Or perhaps you need additional ritual effects?

This is also a great method to help practice the manual dexterity and time taken
to actually resolve the card (especially in paper). Try timing yourself as you
resolve the card. I would expect to have someone take around 1-2 minutes tops in
confidently resolving Doomsday so try to train yourself to get to that speed.

If you find youself sucessfully beating the goldfish you can start changing the
configuration to how the goldfish plays. Maybe pretend they have a Force of Will
and pitch card or are on the play and going to put a Chalice of the Void into
play. You can use these quick situation setups to ready yourselves for proper
games.

### Watch and Analyse Content Creators

There are a vast scope of Legacy content creators out there. Some who enjoy
streaming and others that prefer to make pre-recorded videos. Whatever you
prefer there are definately going to be people who can provide content you may
like to watch. For Doomsday content, we have a lot of it posted in the Discord
under the `#videos-streams-podcasts` channel and likewise in the additional
[Resources Appendix](/appendices/resources).

When watching any Doomsday content you should ask yourself "Would I keep these
hands? If not, why not?". "What pile would I build here? What could the opponent
have here?" Obviously many creators provide this sort of information and thought
process which can be really helpful but maybe try running through it on mute
first with your own ideas then watch again to hear the thought processes behind
the decisions being made.

### Ask Questions

At the end of the day if there is something you don't understand, whether it is
how to execute a pile, the decision made with keeping certain opening hands or
why people are running only 3 of a certain card, please just ask! Wwyd (What
would you do?) scenarios are always a fun way to get people engaged in
discussion and provide you with alternative insights if you are unsure on
something specific.

Whatever it is, if you have searched for it and cannot find what you need then
please just ask someone! Even if they don't know they might talk it through with
you and you might be able to work together to solve it out. Or they may know
someone who does know the answer. Either which way, the community is very chill
and always willing to chip in. We all started somewhere!

## Scenarios

Here are three potential scenarios to have a think through. None of them will
have an objectively correct answer as they contain incomplete information.
Instead they are designed for you to try and think through the potential lines
to take. Some example lines or plays will be written out, including piles, to
promote discussion and thinking.

Feel free to try them out with your intended list as pseudo-goldfish scenarios.

Warning: The potential play choices and pile sections for each scenario goes
very in depth and may be hard to follow along.

### Scenario 1: Turn 1 Doomsday vs Delver

Game 1 turn 1 on the draw with a 6 cards opening hand.

Opponent has a :card[Dragon's Rage Channeler] and a tapped :card[Volcanic
Island] in play, :card[Scalding Tarn] and :card[Mishra's Bauble] in their
Graveyard.

Opponent has 5 cards in hand.

Your hand:

:::row
DD
DR
Misty Rainforest
Daze
Dur
FoW
:::

_What's the play? What's the Pile?_

::::accordion[Click to reveal possible solutions]
This is a fun situation. Delver style decks are always tricky, especially if
they are playing {R}. Given how this matchup usually plays out it is probably
best that we go for it now. We've only one guaranteed initial mana source and we
want to avoid letting the Channeler get too big as it could present a real
threat. Casting Doomsday off of Ritual from Underground Sea is a decent option
as it allows us to leverage the Daze we have in hand but we also might want to
think about whether we need the land drop to stay in play for whatever pile we
want to build. We cannot grab a basic Swamp if run, because the fetchland
doesn't allow it but if it did, that could be another thought to maybe have
access to a non-Wastelandable source to cast the Duress from hand with.

Assuming we do decide to go for it there are a number of factors that we need to
think about if and when Doomsday resolves. Did they have any interaction? If yes
did we fight it with Daze, returning our land to hand or Force of Will pitching
the Daze? This decision weighs up the opportunity cost of having potentially +1
{U} or {B} mana source for our follow up turn/(s) against having a Force of Will
available which could pair with a blue card from our pile.

Our land has to be an Underground Sea so this could get Wastelanded anyways but
there is also potential they do not find one (and if they do, it means they
aren't able to cast double :card[Lightning Bolt] or similar on us next turn.
Does our decision change depending on what interaction they use? If they Daze us
themselves then suddenly they have a very real cost to Wasteland being their
land drop for next turn. If they Force, this cost is much lower.

If they do attempt to counter the Doomsday, what they may or may not reveal off
of Channeler can also matter. They have 2 card types in the graveyard currently.
If they cast a counter spell that will go up to 3 and they may hit a creature or
sorcery from the Surveil. If they do then this guarantees the Channeler being a
3/3 giving you only up to 3 turns available (risking Bolt) as Doomsday will be
taking you to 9 life. Even if they don't hit a creature or sorcery on their turn
there is a good chance they will be able to cast a Ponder or similar thus
getting the increased pressure going.

If they don't have any interaction this means we need to think about the
potential for us having a land in play, a Force and Daze in hand and a slower
time pressure against us. Some of these factors may change but others may remain
the same.

With all this to think about, what do we build if Doomsday resolves?

Assuming the opponent didn't have anything we can maybe take a bit more time
with the pile. We have interaction and less pressure against us. It might be
you interpret this as a sign that they don't have anything in which case you
might be tempted to go all in for a single PTT kill. Alternatively you could
choose to respect the fact that either they are being very patient hoping to
catch you off guard or they might find something from cantripping or the top
of their deck.

In the case of the former school of thought you may look to build something like
this:

> PTT + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
BS
LP
TO
CoS
:::

In the case of the latter thought process, maybe something like this:

> PTT + PTT + PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
Flooded Strand
EoA
TO
CoS
Island
:::

The first example expects the opponent to not Wasteland you and for you to be
able to resolve a Brainstorm. The initial cycler needs to be SW instead of Edge
because you likely will need the Underground Sea to be able to cast Daze off of.
This will provide you with +1 additional card to return to the deck with
Brainstorm if you need to use it. The pile itself will result in an imperfect
pile assuming you want to try and win the turn immediately following Doomsday's
resolution but hopefully the Daze is sufficient to protect the Oracle.

Let's run through the first pile assuming we PTT once:

1. Draw SW for turn
1. Cycle SW, draw BS
1. Cast BS, draw , LP, TO, CoS, put back Duress, Force
1. Cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Play Cavern naming Wizard or Merfolk
1. Cast Oracle and win the game with 2 cards left in deck

If they do Wasteland you then suddenly you have to pass the turn a total of 4
times to be able to access {U}{U} and Oracle making this quite risky.

For the second pile this gives more options to us. You draw and play the Strand
for your next turn and, if they didn't remove the Sea, you can cast the Duress
against them, maybe taking a Bolt or other threatening spell. Passing again will
get you the Edge which you could use to cycle into the Oracle (sacrificing the
Sea and floating {U} to then be able to fetch for the Island and cast Oracle
with 2 cards left in deck and Force of Will backup. If you are able to wait the
full three turns though it will be able to beat any amount of countermagic for
Oracle, be a perfect pile and only cost 1 life in the process (2 if you need to
use Force of Will) with some backup protection. The only downside is you will be
getting hit by Channeler each turn.

Obviously these piles might change if you did face interaction and the situation
around how you dealt with it but they provide a solid foundation for options.
You can't play around and beat everything but you should always decide what
cards you are happy to lose to and which you want to play around.

Some cards from this scenario you might want to have thought about:

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Force of Will
Dragon's Rage Channeler
Daze
Lightning Bolt
Wasteland
:::

### Scenario 2: Turn 1 Doomsday vs Mono Red Stompy

Game 3 turn 1 on the play with a 5 cards opening hand.

Your hand:

:::row
DD
DR
Misty Rainforest
LP
FoW
:::

_What's the play? What's the Pile?_

::::accordion[Click to reveal possible solutions]
Stompy decks are often a very play/draw dependant situation and heavily based
around the strength of each player's respective opening hands. Ours is not
bad as it allows us to cast Doomsday before being disrupted by any sort of lock
piece. We don't have any inherent protection however with the Force being devoid
of any pitch card.

We are certainly casting Doomsday here but we are faced with an initial decision
on what initial mana source we do it from. We could play our land, fetch Sea and
then resolve DR into DD, casting LP afterwards to insulate us from
:card[Blood Moon] effects and/or Chalice of the Void on 0. We could also cast
DR off of Petal and hold up the Misty to then access a basic Island from the
pile both insulating our mana and digging deeper into the pile.

Once you have decided which mana source to utilise you will need to resolve
Doomsday and decide what cards to play around.

Some potential interaction you could face:

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Chalice of the Void
Trinisphere
Blood Moon
Magus of the Moon
Pyroblast
Goblin Rabblemaster
:::

There's a lot to think about here. Ideally you'll want to have a basic Island
in the pile somewhere to pair with a Lotus Petal to enable {U}{U} under a Moon
Effect but you also want to be insulated against Chalice on 2 or a Pyroblast so
a Cavern is a decent choice to include. Beyond this simply, having 3 mana
sources enables you to beat Trinisphere. You could also look to utilise cyclers
and LED to ignore all of it and just try to jam Oracle that way. No matter what
you choose you might also want to execute it faster rather than slower as
Rabblemaster presents a fast clock if they have it (getting you dead in 3 turns
from 9 life or at the very least preventing the use of SW if you pass twice).

Here are a few examples to think about:

> PTT + fetchland

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
LP
TO
CoS
Island
:::

> PTT + PTT + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
Island
EoA
TO
CoS
TO
:::

> PTT + PTT

:::row{variant=PILE}
LED
EoA
EoA
TO
CoS
:::

> PTT + PTT + fetchland

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
TO
CoS
TO
Island
:::

Some of these play around some of the potential cards discussed, others ignore
some of them. It might be you can beat them but only if they are played in a
certain order. The last example uses the Brainstorm as a way to either use as a
pitch card for Force, or better yet to access the second Oracle to pitch instead
(and reducing the pile size as a result). You can even build piles that allow
you to use Daze + Island alongside a Petal to get {U}{U} from the same Island
twice by Daze-ing your own LP if they have a Chalice on 0 and a Blood Moon.

As before you cannot play around everything so try to pick your fight and commit
accordingly. Sometimes you get it wrong, this is fine. There is variance in the
game and just because you might have picked wrong, doesn't mean it was the
incorrect choice.

### Scenario 3: Turn 3 Doomsday vs Elves

Game 2 turn 3.

Opponent has an :card[Allosaurus Shepherd], :card[Dryad Arbor] (tapped),
:card[Elvish Visionary] and a :card[Forest] (tapped) in play.

Opponent has 6 cards in hand.

You have 2 Underground Sea in play, 18 Life and your land drop available to you.

Your hand:

:::row
DD
LP
SW
Flooded Strand
FoW
:::

_What's the play? What's the Pile?_

::::accordion[Click to reveal possible solutions]
Here we have a game that is already in full swing. Perhaps you had issues
finding the fast mana needed to resolve Doomsday (maybe needing to mulligan
more?). No matter how you got to this scenario, you have now found the mana to
cast Doomsday in the face of a non-counterspell deck and drawn a little extra in
the form of the Lotus Petal for the turn. We are now faced with some interesting
choices.

First of all let's look at the list of cards we want to be thinking about in the
matchup. (There may be other cards involved in spicier variants but these are
the more likely ones).

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Endurance
Thoughtseize
Craterhoof Behemoth
Surgical Extraction
Allosaurus Shepherd
Collector Ouphe
Veil of Summer
:::

The first card to note here is :card[Allosaurus Shepherd]. Shepherd has
basically cut off the potential to use countermagic effectively which means that
protecting yourself if you decide to perform a pass-the-turn pile is difficult,
especially with the potential for a :card[Natural Order] or similar haymaker to
come down. Conversely though, if you want to try and attempt a same turn win
here you are not going to be able to stop an Endurance if they have one which
could prevent your win.

The first major decision is whether we are going to try and go for the win now
or attempt to wait one turn (or setup to try and do both). Once we have commited
to this decision it allows us to know what mana we are using to cast Doomsday;
that is whether we are cracking the fetchland for a third Underground Sea and
saving Petal, cracking the fetchland and Petal for {B}{B}{B}{U} in total prior
to Doomsday or whether we are using the Petal for {B} and saving the Strand to
then retrieve a land from the pile.

Let's look at a few options we could try and see how they compare against our
potential "interaction list".

> SW + X + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
LED
SW
Con
TO
:::

This pile you should recognise easily. It's a simple Cycler + mana pile using
Brainstorm and Consider to be able to dig through the entire pile and surveil
away the dead Force of Will. It gets around most of the interaction the opponent
could be holding other than Endurance and :card[Surgical Extraction]. This pile
just straight up loses to Endurance but, as the opponent may not have one and
could only be running up to 4 in the deck anyway, there is only a 56.6% chance
they have one. Just over half.

Surgical is possible to beat and has a worst-case scenario of causing you to
need to pass the turn once if it manages to "get you" with only a 33.3% chance
of it failing if they respond to the Street Wraith cycle after cracking LED.

These odds are certainly not the worst and with it being your turn 3 in Game 2
(having won Game 1) the potential punishment for them having the answer is not
too significant and may be less risky than trying to pass and them finding a
more significant set of interaction.

We could also look at this:

> SW + X + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
LED
SW
TO
TO
:::

As the opponent cannot cast any removal currently, and Endurance is still their
biggest threat to this same turn win, we could look to try doing an impefect BS
pile with two Oracles included. Let's talk through how this pile plays out and
assume our opponent waits until the very last minute (Oracle Trigger on the
stack) to commit Endurance. We start with having cracked Petal and Strand pre-
Doomsday to ensure less cards in our graveyard:

1. Cycle SW into pile, draw BS
1. Cast BS, draw LED, SW, TO, put back FoW and TO on top
1. Cast LED
1. Cycle SW, hold priority crack LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw TO
1. Cast TO to try and win with 2 cards in deck
1. Opponent casts Endurance, trigger resolves
1. Oracle trigger resolves, see Force and Oracle

This is the part where we have an interesting decision. Our deck is currently
7 cards (FoW, TO and then some order of DD, SW, SW, LED, BS). If we were to
resolve the trigger and just keep Oracle on top that would only give us a
potential devotion to {U} of 4 for the following turn with still 6 cards left
in the deck. As a result we would need to pass again and hope to draw a cantrip
at that (but we would probably die by then). As a result we should probably
just let TO then FoW go to the bottom and try to get through the pile hoping
to draw exactly SW into SW into BS. Not likely at all.

Conceptually it's a decent plan but it realistically loses just as hard to
Endurance as the first example we presented.

As the same turn win attempts seem to be fairly straightforwards, let's have a
look at some of the PTT options.

> PTT + {U}{U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
IU
SW
TO
Island
EoA
:::

This is a nice clean pile that allows you to beat double Endurance if need be.
It helps that you have an extra cycler already in hand just in case. The 4 life
from the SW shouldn't matter as either than can hit you for just 3 with their
board or for lethal from Natural Order or Cradle into Activate Shepherd.
The pile also ignores collector Ouphe which is handy but can be scuppered by a
Boseiju on their turn/in your upkeep/draw step hitting your lands.
This pile favours having cracked your Strand to cast Doomsday and actually
keeping your Petal in hand entirely.

Let's run through the pile assuming they have 2 Endurance:

1. Resolve Doomsday, pass the turn
1. Draw IU for turn
1. Cast IU, draw SW, TO, Island
1. Play Island
1. Cast Oracle to try and win with 1 card in deck
1. Opponent casts Endurance, trigger resolves
1. Cycle SW, draw EoA
1. Oracle trigger is still on the stack with 2 cards in deck
1. Opponent casts Endurance, trigger resolves
1. Cycle Edge, draw IU or DD
1. Oracle trigger resolves, win the game with 2 cards in deck

This gets messier if they have removal like :card[Abrupt Decay] or if they hit
you with a Thoughtseize or similar but otherwise it is a very neat way to try
and win.

What about without IU?:

> PTT + Flooded Strand + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
SW
TO
EoA
EoA
Island
:::

This pile you need to ensure you cast Doomsday from the mana of Lotus Petal and
have not cracked Flooded Strand beforehand. It can beat one Endurance neatly.
Let's see how it plays out:

1. Resolve Doomsday, pass the turn
1. Draw SW for turn
1. Cycle SW, draw TO
1. Crack Flooded Strand, fetch Island
1. Cast Oracle to try and win with 2 cards in deck
1. Opponent casts Endurance, trigger resolves
1. Cycle SW, draw Edge
1. Cycle Edge, draw Edge
1. Oracle trigger resolves, win the game with 2 cards in deck

Let's look at one more potential PTT pile.

> PTT + Flooded Strand + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
TO
TO
LP
Island
:::

Again this pile requires you to have cast Doomsday off of Lotus Petal. This is
a pile that looks to cast 2 Oracle in a single turn.

1. Resolve Doomsday, pass the turn
1. Draw BS for turn
1. Cast BS, draw TO, TO, LP, put back FoW, SW
1. Crack Flooded Strand, fetch Island
1. Cast Oracle to try and win with 2 cards in deck
1. If required, cast LP, crack for {U}
1. Cast Oracle to try and win with 2 cards in deck

Again the theory is sound but if they did have an Endurance to interrupt you
in response to the first Oracle's trigger, you would go to 5 cards in your deck
which would then force you to pass the turn again as you would only have a
total potential devotion of 4.

## Next Steps

Hopefully you enjoyed all that! What's next on the agenda then? Go and play some
games! Whether it's on Magic Online, via Cockatrice, at your local FNM or just
with a full deck of proxies on the kitchen table with friends. Nothing beats
just jamming some games to get a feel for the deck and, as we said at the start:
practice makes perfect!
