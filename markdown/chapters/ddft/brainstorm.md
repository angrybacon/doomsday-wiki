title: Brainstorm in Doomsday

## Table of Contents

## Preamble

Brainstorm is one of the most powerful spells available in the Legacy format at
this time. There have been numerous articles written on this *seemingly
innocuous at first glance* one mana cantrip. We'll assume you know the basics of
casting Brainstorm, and instead focus on the specifics of using it as a part of,
or to initiate, your doomsday piles. In many cases it can be used as any other
cantrip, but it has unique applications to Doomsday piles, allowing you to swap
cards in hand for cards in the pile.

One of the more difficult things of playing Doomsday Storm combo is recognizing
situations where you have the resources to win. Beginning players often start
out with learning only a few piles by heart. While this helps with getting
started, there will be many chances to win that they will miss out on.

Brainstorm can act as a simple cantrip into a pile, but it can do more
interesting things as well.

Let's discuss some examples:

## Example 1

If you have a win condition in hand, you can Brainstorm to insert it into the
pile, swapping it for additional mana.

> BS, BW in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {1}{U} - 8 Storm

:::row{variant=PILE}
- LED
- IU
- SW
- LP
- LED
:::

1. Cast Doomsday and build the above pile
2. Cast BS, draw LED, IU, SW and put back BW, IU
3. Cast LED
4. Activate SW, hold priority cracking LED for {U}{U}{U}, draw IU
5. Cast IU, draw BW, LP, LED
6. Cast LED
7. Cast LP
8. Cast BW, hold priority and crack LED for {B}{B}{B}, get ToA
9. Cast ToA

You can see that this not only decreases the total cost of the pile by 1 mana,
but also drastically reduces the amount of blue mana needed. This is useful,
since it lets Brainstorm act almost like a ritual, effectively *producing*
{U}{U} mana for Ideas Unbound. It also increases the Storm count by 1 compared
to the basic pile, since you get an extra spell in the pile.

## Example 2

The extra card in hand need not be a win condition; any card that you want in
your pile can be swapped in with Brainstorm.

> BS, LP in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {1}{U}{B} - 9 Storm


:::row{variant=PILE}
- IC
- DR
- BW
- LED
- LED
:::

1. Cast Doomsday and build the above pile
2. Cast BS, draw IC, DR, BW, put back BW, LP
3. Cast DR, IC, draw LP, BW, LED, LED
4. Cast LED, LED, LP
5. Cast BW, hold priority and crack LEDs for {B}{B}{B}{B}{B}{B}, get ToA
6. Cast ToA

In this example, you can see that the Storm count is again increased, as well as
the amount of black mana needed decreased. Here, Brainstorm is letting you swap
the Petal for a DR to cast IC.

## Example 3

Cards in hand need not even be "useful" at all. Dead cards can be traded in as
well.

> BS, Land in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
- LED
- SW
- Pnd
- TO
- Pnd
:::

1. Cast Doomsday and build the above pile
2. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, Ponder, put back Land, then Ponder
3. Cast LED, cycle SW, holding priority to crack LED for {U}{U}{U}
4. Draw Ponder and cast it to draw Oracle
5. Cast Oracle
6. Oracle triggers with 2 cards left in the deck to win

While this pile is vulnerable to removal on Oracle, its also extremely cheap and
works with a rather bad hand.

## Example 4

The Brainstorm can even be in the pile, if you have another cantrip to retrieve
it.

> Ponder, Land in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {U}{U}

:::row{variant=PILE}
- BS
- LED
- SW
- Pnd
- TO
:::

1. Cast Doomsday and build the above pile
2. Cast Ponder to draw Brainstorm
2. Cast Brainstorm, draw LED, SW, Ponder, put back Land, then Ponder
3. Cast LED, cycle SW, holding priority to crack LED for {U}{U}{U}
4. Draw Ponder and cast it to draw Oracle
5. Cast Oracle
6. Oracle triggers with 1 cards left in the deck to win

After you Ponder into the pile, this one is identical to the previous example.
At the cost of only 1 more mana you can turn your mere Ponder into a fancy
Brainstorm to then turn your dead cards into live ones.

## Conclusion

1. You can use BS to exchange resources between your hand and the pile
2. These resources need not be mana or wincons; dead cards/slots in your pile
   are resources in this sense.
3. Be judicious with your Brainstorms pre-combo, as they can be powerful
   enablers for your combo turn.
