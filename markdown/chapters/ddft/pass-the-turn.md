title: Pass-the-Turn Piles
---

First of all, why would you ever want to cast Doomsday and then pass the turn?
The answer is simple: when you can't win otherwise. It should be clear that pass-the-turn
piles are rarely a desirable plan as there are significant risks involved in paying half your life
and saying "Go."

One of the main uses of pass-the-turn piles is
to become immune to discard. Under the right conditions, you can cast Doomsday, pass,
and untap with all the resources you need to win on the battlefield or the top of your deck,
thereby invalidating an opponent's interaction. 

Another situation in which you may choose to do a pass the turn pile is when you don't have a
draw effect, but your life total is not threatened. Here you can use your draw step as the cantrip. 
This also reduces the amount of mana you need to go off in one turn.

## Pass-the-Turn Piles with Thassa's Oracle

Thassa's Oracle is a substantial improvement to the deck, not least of all because of the extremely cheap
pass-the-turn piles it enables. Most are quite straightforward and many are nearly identical to their same-turn counterparts.
Let's look at some basic examples.

### Example 1  
> {{UU}}

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

Imagine you have an Island and and Underground Sea on board, Dark Ritual and Doomsday in hand. You can
Ritual into Doomsday, pass the turn, and win with a mere 2 blue mana and 2 life when you untap. In fact you could
conceivably cast Doomsday on turn 1, and make your second land drop to generate {{UU}}.

### Example 2  
> {{BBB}}

<row variant="pile">{{!IC}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

This is essentially the same pile as Example 1, but with Infernal Contract as the draw spell. It has a different cost,
but it's worth noting that this could be paid with a Ritual, meaning fewer lands needed if the situation permits.

### Example 3  
> Lion's Eye Diamond on the board - {{0}}

<row variant="pile">{{!SW}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

If you have an LED on the battlefield, you can win for just 2 life, no mana needed. This can be very valuable, because
there may be times where you lose lands after passing the turn. Invalidating mana-denial and discard can be valuable against
a deck like Pox, which, while uncommon, you will surely encounter at some point.

### Example 4
>Ponder in hand - {{U}}

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

This pile is similar to the last, but swaps the locations of the cantrip and the LED. You might use a pile like this when
you are constrained on mana and don't have enough resources to go off all in one turn. For example, with a single Underground Sea,
you could cast Dark Ritual and Doomsday on one turn, and Ponder on the next, where you wouldn't have the mana to do it all
in one turn.


## Pass-the-Turn Piles with Tendrils of Agony

Generating a lethal storm count can be tricky when you have to pass the turn. A standard five card pile ending with Burning Wish
for Tendrils will only generate 6 Storm on its own, which is unlikely to be lethal. Having additional Rituals or mana artifacts
in hand can help add to storm count, but even then it can be difficult to approach double-digit Storm counts.
Thassa's Oracle has made it so these kinds of piles are often unecessary, but if you are unlucky you may find yourself with Oracle
exiled, nothing but a Doomsday in hand, and you'll be glad you read this section.

### Example 1
> 2 cards in hand - {{UU}} - 8 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!Echo}} {{!BW}}</row>

Echo of Eons in the maindeck provides some very interesting pile options, which are explored more in-depth in a later chapter.
One powerful application is building a high storm count by recycling multiple spells post-Doomsday. In this example, you draw
Ideas Unbound, which draws 2 LEDs and an Echo of Eons. Crack both LEDs for RRRUUU, and spend your blue mana to flashback Echo.
This will draw the remaining 7 cards. Recast the mana artifacts, then the Burning Wish to grab Tendrils and cast it off LED mana.

This pile is quite mana efficient, and even approaches a lethal storm count on its own. If the 2 cards in hand are castable spells
(i.e. Rituals, Petals) you can easily reach a lethal storm count assuming you have the resources to cast those spells. Echo creates some
unusual constraints on the pile though: the precise number of cards leftover is important so Echo doesn't kill you, and there is
a chance your opponent draws a fresh hand full of interaction.

### Example 2
> LED, LP on board - {{1UU}} - 9 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!DD}} {{!Pn}} {{!BW}}</row>

1. Cast Ideas Unbound, holding priority to crack LED for {{BBB}}, drawing LED, Ponder and Doomsday
2. Cast LED, crack the Petal for {{U}}, then cast DD with the floating black mana
3. Construct the following new pile:

<row variant="pile"> {{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!BW}} {{!DD}} </row>

4. Ponder into this new pile, holding priority to crack LED for {{UUU}}
5. Draw and cast Ideas Unbound to draw LED, Petal, and Burning Wish
6. Cast LED, Petal, and then Wish, holding priority to crack LED for {{BBB}}
7. Retrive Tendrils of Agony from your sideboard and aim it at your opponent

This what is often referred to as a Double-Doomsday pile, where a second Doomsday is used as a way to recycle spells.
While the initial mana cost looks relatively low and the Storm count quite high, the pile is actually quite mana hungry
and you need additional mana artifacts on board (or in hand for extra storm) to supply that mana. Note that this pile also
halves your life total twice, meaning you'll need at least 4 life to execute. Though it appears clumsy, this pile does not require
any unusual card choices and does not draw your opponent any new cards, so it has some appealing aspects.

### Example 3
> 5 lands in play - {{1BBBB}} - 5 Storm + 6 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IC}} {{!RoF}} {{!CR}} {{!CB}} {{!ToA}}</row>

This pile, on the other hand, does require some less commmon card choices. It works by using CB to cast ToA twice.
To do it from no cards in hand requires a ton of lands on board, as well as {{Rain of
Filth}}, {{Conjurer's Bauble}}, and maindeck Tendrils, which not every deck plays. However, with some mana producers in hand
the onboard requirements are easier to manage.

### Example 4
> DR in hand, PiF in sideboard - {{BBRR}} - 10 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!BW}} {{!ToA}}</row>

If you have Past in Flames in the sideboard you can use that as an engine to
generate lethal storm.

This pile doesn't require the use of an artifact meaning it can beat a Null Rod
or a {{Phyrexian Revoker}}, although having an LED available will make producing
{{RR}} easier.

The final Tendrils can be replaced with Burning Wish, but this will increase the cost of the pile by {{R}}, effectively requiring a
mana artifact to be available in hand or on board.


## Conclusion

1. You don't always have to win the turn you cast Doomsday
2. Pass-the-turn piles can be cheap and effective, especially when Thassa's Oracle is involved
3. PTT piles leave you more susceptible to disruption
4. It is possible to generate lethal Storm counts despite passing the turn, typically by using tricks to recycle cards. Mana is usually the primary constraint in such piles.
5. Note that all of these piles can be used as same-turn piles, you simply need the extra resources to cast Doomsday and draw into your pile on the same turn.
