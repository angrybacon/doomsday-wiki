title: Playing Around Interaction

## Table of Contents

## Preamble

In general, the easiest way to play around interaction is using discard and countermagic. However, because the core of the Tin Fins combo is Instant speed, there are a number of ways to play around different pieces interaction on the stack without those effects.

By playing patiently and knowing when to go for your combo, you can steal wins that would potherwise be missed. 

## Comboing in Response to Interaction

Because the Tin Fins combo is Instant speed, you are able to combo off in response to interaction/hate, in response to your opponent's combo, or even in your opponents end step. 

## Removal

- StP
- Solitude
- Karakas
:::

Tin Fins is able to play around removal on Griselbrand fairly easily. Most players will wait until you activate Griselbrand the first time before casting a removal spell. Because of this, you can usually activate Griselbrand a second time to find a piece of countermagic to answer the removal spell. 

If you're unable to counter the removal, such as Karakas, it is still correct to draw as many cards as possible before it resolves. Generally, drawing 14 cards is enough to allow you to combo again in the same turn, as discussed in the [Playing the Deck](/markdown/chapters/entombsday/playing-the-deck) section.

## Graveyard Hate

### Leyline Effects

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Leyline of the Void
- Rest in Peace
- Dauthi Voidwalker
:::

These effects are the primary reason we play the Doomsday transformation in the sideboard. Nothing feels better than your opponent mulling to two or three for a Leyline of the Void and casting Dark Ritual into Doomsday on your turn.

While Leyline of the Void and Rest in Peace are functionally blank cards against the Doomsday plan, Dauthi Voidwalker still poses a threat. Because Dauthi Voidwalker allows the opponent to cast cards exiled with it, you'll need to be careful about what cards you cast, discard and mill. Notably, this affects piles using :card[Consider] when the card being milled could be useful to the opponent: Force of Will, Daze, Flusterstorm, or even Emrakul, the Aeons Torn.

### Cards that Empty the Graveyard

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Bojuka Bog
- Endurance
- Faerie Macabre
:::

Cards like Bojuka Bog, Endurance, and Faerie Macabre are some of the easiest to play around for Tin Fins. The general play pattern to beat these effects is to *bin* your Griselbrand, bait the interaction with a Shallow Grave, then simply cast a second copy of Entomb (or crack LED) to bin another Griselbrand after the effect resolves. 

Note that Shallow Grave is required here, as it does not target a specific card.

### Surgical Extraction

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Surgical Extraction
:::

While similar to the previously mentioned effects, Surgical Extraction requires the inverse play pattern. Since Surgical Extraction exiles all copies of the chosen card, you can't allow it to resolve. To beat these effects, you will need two reanimation effects instead of two Entomb effects is you're unable to just counter the spell.

In this scenario, you can bait the Surgical using the first reanimation spell, then you can respond to Surgical with the second. Things can get weird if they have two copies of Surgical, but you also run discard spells and countermagic, so you can use those to force them to Surgical before you cast your reanimation or just counter their Surgical.
