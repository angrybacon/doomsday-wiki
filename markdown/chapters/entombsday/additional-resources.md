This introduction to Entombsday was made possible by [Walked's original Entombsday primer][primer:walked] and [Acclimation's Tin Fins primer][primer:acclimation].

While outdated, the [Tin Fins primer on MTGTheSource][primer:thesource] is still a great resource for the history of the deck, the general play patterns, and quality Sealab memes.

Current discussion of Tin Fins and its variants happens in the [Sealab Discord server][discord:sealab].

And, most importantly, make sure to join the discussion of Entombsday and Turbo Doomsday in the [Doomsday Discord server][discord:doomsday]
