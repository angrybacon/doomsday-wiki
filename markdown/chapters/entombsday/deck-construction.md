## Table of Contents

## Preamble

As previously stated, the shell of both Tin Fins and Doomsday are remarkably similar and the combo packages are roughly the same size. Because of this overlap, there are very few concessions made in deckbuilding.

Below are an Entombsday list and a Turbo Doomsday list:

::decklist{path=2023/03/entombsday.drynne}
::decklist{path=2023/03/turbo.eternalrant}

As you can see, the maindeck of both lists only differs by ~25 cards, with many of those being due to the choice of specific fetchlands, discard spells, and counterspells. The deckbuilding ratios are nearly the same. You'll also notice that many of the missing cards from the Doomsday maindeck are present in the sideboard of the Entombsday list.

## General Deckbuilding Principles

The idea behind modern builds of Entombsday is to take the Turbo Doomsday shell, move the Doomsday package to the sideboard (Doomsday, Tutors, Thassa's Oracle, and pile cards), then add in the Tin FIns combo package.

As such, the deckbuilding ideas mirror those expressed in the [Deck Construction Priciples chapter of the Doomsday Wiki](/markdown/chapters/meandeck/deck-construction).

### The Combo Packages

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Entomb
- Shallow Grave
- Griselbrand
:::

The core combo package of Tin Fins consists of a minimum of 4 :card[Entomb], 6 reanimation spells, 2 :card[Griselbrand], 1 :card[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn], and 1 :card[Children of Korlis]. 

The Doomsday package in the sideboard is somewhat streamlined compared to current Doomsday list. We still run 4 copies of :card[Doomsday], 2 :card[Thassa's Oracle], and a :card[Cavern of Souls], but we only have space for 2 copies of :card[Personal Tutor], 2 :card[Street Wraith], and 1 :card[Edge of Autumn].

### Notable Inclusions

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Emrakul, the Aeons Torn
- Lim-Dul's Vault
- Scrubland
:::

:card[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn] - While she has generally fallen out of favor in :card[Doomsday] lists, Emrakul is integral to the Tin Fins strategy as she allows looping the deck and swinging for lethal.

:card[Cabal Therapy] - This enables several interactions that are important to the Tin Fins half of the deck: it is a way to discard yourself without needing to pay the 2 life for Thoughtseize and it allows you to sacrifice your Griselbrand to put it back into your graveyard for next turn if you whiff on your combo turn.

:card[Lim-Dul’s Vault] - While slow, LDV allows you to find Entomb, a reanimation spell, and Doomsday. Unless :card[Mystical Tutor] gets unbanned (Ha!), it’s our best option for a tutor that finds both combos.

:card[Consider] - Consider is a card that has been discussed at length in the context of :card[Doomsday] and is included for those reasons. It has the additional upside of being able to *bin* Griselbrand or Emrakul directly from your library (generally after setting it up with a Brainstorm).

:card[Shelldock Isle] - This is another card that has seen less inclusion in Doomsday lists, but we include it since we already have an Emrakul in the deck. This enables some fairly simple piles that play around :card[Endurance] and :card[Painter’s Servant] + :card[Grindstone].

:card[Scrubland] - While most Doomsday lists have no need for a {W} source, Entombsday wants to be able to cast :card[Children of Korlis] off of lands in the event you don’t draw a :card[Lotus Petal] while comboing. 

### Flex Slots

:card[Collective Brutality] - CoBru is an uncountable way to *bin* Griselbrand or Emrakul. Simply cast it with at least one Escalate mode and you are able to discard a card as a cost. CoBru also allows you to win without the combat step by draining your opponent for 2 life every time you *loop* your library. Despite these upsides, the card is clunky and can be considered a flex slot.

:card[Personal Tutor] - While it is a staple of Turbo Doomsday lists and generally run as a four-of there, we run it as a two-of or not at all. It makes the Doomsday plan more consistent at the cost of our already limited sideboard slots.

:card[Thassa’s Oracle] - A single copy is required for the :card[Doomsday] plan. Running a second is optional and can be replaced with a draw spell such as :card[Predict] or :card[Ideas Unbound].

### Other Options


Here is another example Entombsday list running several of the below options:

::decklist{path=2023/03/entombsday.Nitro_Rick}

:card[Chrome Mox] - This can be run as Lotus Petal number five, which can allow you to combo off sooner and give you an additional way to continue comboing after drawing 14 cards with Griselbrand.

:card[Predict] and :card[Ideas Unbound] - Predict and Ideas Unbound allow you to quickly draw through your Doomsday pile and build protection into it at the cost of making you vulverable to disruption like :card[Pyroblast]/[:cardRed Elemental Blast].

:card[Chain of Vapor] - Cheaper to cast than :card[Echoing Truth], but can’t bounce :card[Chalice of the Void] on 1.

:card[Reanimate] - Tin Fins lists will sometimes run a single copy of Reanimate to allow you additional routes to combo off, as well as allowing you to reanimate Children of Korlis using fewer reources. This is generally not standard for Entombsday, but is an option if you would like to try it. It can also enable Doomsday piles that mill Thassa's Oracle with Consider, but this opens you up to graveyard hate, which Entombsday is built to dodge.
