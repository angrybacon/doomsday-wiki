## Preamble

Entombsday is a Tin Fins and Doomsday hybrid combo deck.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Entomb
Griselbrand
Doomsday
:::

Tin Fins is a Reanimator variant that primarily aims to reanimate
:card[Griselbrand] with haste using either :card[Shallow Grave] or :card[Goryo’s
Vengeance], then draw enough cards to reanimate :card[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn]
and attack for 22 damage. To enable this, the deck runs :card[Children of
Korlis] to regain the life paid to :card[Griselbrand] and enable us to
frequently draw our entire deck.

:card[Doomsday] aims to win the game by casting the namesake card and building a
pile of 5 cards to win the game, typically using :card[Thassa’s Oracle].

The Tin Fins gameplan is incredibly strong in game 1, but is vulnerable to many
common sideboard hate cards (:card[Leyline of the Void], :card[Endurance],
:card[Surgical Extraction], and more). To work around this, the deck is able to
transform into Doomsday in sideboarded games, functionally invalidating the
opponents hate cards. Using :card[Doomsday] as your transformational plan works
exceptionally well, as the core combo package of both plans is ~13 cards, while
the rest of the shell is virtually identical for both decks.

## History

Tin Fins players are no strangers to transformational sideboards and hybrid
gameplans. The deck has frequently run sideboard cards such as :card[Monastery
Mentor] to dodge the aforementioned graveyard hate pieces. In fact,
:card[Doomsday] had been discussed as a sideboard option for Tin Fins for years
prior to the printing of Thassa’s Oracle. The current Entombsday build was
popularized by _Walked_/_Walkedairplane_ toward the end of 2020 and has
continued to evolve from there.

## Why Play Entombsday?

Tin Fins is fun to play. Doomsday is fun play. As the old Reese's ad goes,
they're "two great tastes that taste great together"!

From a more objective point of view, both game plans cover each other's
weaknesses well. Tin Fins is a safer combo against decks such as Delver that
pressure your life total by letting you choose how much life to invest, rather
than the hard half of your life total that Doomsday requires. Meanwhile, the
Doomsday combo doesn't use the graveyard and is more effectively able to 'go
off' and then pass the turn. Both plans require little-to-no sacrifice for the
other gameplan, and allow for some unique gameplay patterns utilizing cards from
both plans.

Ever cast a Shallow Grave to rebuy a Thassa's Oracle? How about sacrificing
Children of Korlis after casting Doomsday?

All of this and more is possible through the power of Entombsday!

## Additional Resources

These chapters aim to be an introduction to Entombsday and was made possible by
[_Walked_'s original Entombsday primer][primer:walked] and [Acclimation's Tin
Fins primer][primer:acclimation]. Both of these primers are great resources. If
you have questions that are not covered here, they may have been asked or
answered before in one of the below resources.

While outdated, the [Tin Fins primer on MTGTheSource][primer:mtgthesource] is
still a great resource for the history of the deck, the general play patterns,
and quality Sealab memes.

Current discussion of Tin Fins and its variants happens in the [Sealab Discord
server][discord:sealab].

And, most importantly, make sure to join the discussion of Entombsday and Turbo
Doomsday in the [Doomsday Discord server][discord:doomsday]
