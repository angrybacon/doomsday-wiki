## Preamble

As a deck with two unique gameplans, Entombsday requires some flexibility from
its pilot. Knowing the ins-and-outs of both Tin Fins and Doomsday will improve
your performance with the deck, as will developing your own heuristics for when
to use which plan.

Because this Wiki already contains excellent resources for how to play Turbo
Doomsday, we will primarily focus on the Tin Fins plan and when to _transform_
into Doomsday.

## Playing Tin Fins

Fundamentally, Tin Fins is a reanimator combo deck. You are looking to _bin_ a
copy of Griselbrand, then reanimate Griselbrand. Where Tin Fins differs from
traditional reanimator builds is the use of :card[Shallow Grave] and
:card[Goryo's Vengeance]. Because these cards are Instants and grant Haste, they
allow you to win on your combo turn. The most common way this is done is by
reanimating :card[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn] before going to combat and attacking
with Griselbrand and Emrakul for 22 damage.

The deck also includes :card[Children of Korlis] to enable to you to draw your
whole deck with Griselbrand. Children of Korlis also enables you to loop your
deck to allow wins post-combat, which will be discussed below.

### The Combo Turn

Your combo turn is the turn in which you reanimate Griselbrand and attempt to
win. The combo turn generally proceds as follows:

1. Cast Entomb to bin Griselbrand
1. Cast Shallow Grave or Goryo's Vengeance to reanimate Griselbrand
1. Draw 7 to 14 cards, looking for another Entomb + reanimation spell or
   Children of Korlis
1. Then, depending on your draws:
   - Cast Entomb to bin Emrakul, reanimate it before the shuffle trigger
     resolves, then attack for 22 damage
   - Cast Children of Korlis to regain the life paid this turn and continue
     drawing cards until you can

### General Tips

- Goryo's Venegance can only target a legendary craeture. It is better to use
  that to reanimate your Griselbrand and save your Shallow Graves for Children
  of Korlis.
- Shallow Grave and Goryo's Vengeance create a delayed trigger that will exile
  the creature reanimated with them at the beginning of the next End Step.
  Because of this, you can cast them on your opponent's End Step and still have
  the creature in play for your turn.
- You can sacrifice the in-play Griselbrand to :card[Cabal Therapy]'s Flashback
  cost to put it back in your graveyard for next turn, bypassing the delayed
  trigger from Goryo's Vengeance or Shallow Grave.
- The life gain from Children of Korlis cares about total life lost this turn.
  In paper, make sure you track every point of life lost (fetchland activations,
  Thoughtseizes cast, etc.)
- Be mindful of both your life total and the number of cards in your library.
  You don't want to draw twice from 14 life or draw seven cards with only six
  left in your deck.
- If you find that you're missing one combo piece before going to combat, you
  can try to cast some of your cantrips to dig a little deeper into your deck.
  This is also useful if you have less than seven cards left in deck and need to
  find a specific piece.
- Entomb can tutor for :card[Cabal Therapy] if you need access to a discard
  spell on your combo turn &mdash; if your Emrakul or Children is stuck in your
  hand and you don't have a Thoughtseize or Brainstorm &mdash; or need to
  sacrifice your Griselbrand to avoid the exile trigger from Shallow Grave and
  Goryo's Vengeance.

### Entombing Without Entomb

While Entombsday only runs two copies of Griselbrand, you will still find hands
that have a copy in them. If you're on 7 cards on the draw, it can be correct to
keep these hands and use your cleanup step to discard Griselbrand. This does not
work for Emrakul, since you will never get the opportunity attack before it is
exiled to the Shallow Grave or Goryo's Vengeance trigger on your opponents' end
step.

### Lion's Eye Diamond in Tin Fins

:card[Lion's Eye Diamond] is a tricky card to use properly due to the rules
weirdness surrounding it. It is primarily included in the deck for its use in
Doosday piles, but there are a few important interactions to be aware of for the
Tin Fins half of the deck.

LED can be used to _bin_ a Griselbrand in response to a :card[Shallow Grave].
This unfortunately does not work with Emrakul, as her shuffle trigger will be
stacked on top of Shallow Grave and leave you with an empty graveyard when
Shallow Grave resolves.

Similar to its use in Storm decks and Doomsday piles, LED can be cracked in
response to a Griselbrand activation to make the mana available for the cards
you will be drawing. Just make sure you hold priority when activating
Griselbrand by holding Control on MTGO or announcing it in paper.

### What If You Whiff?

If you did not find a way to continue comboing in your first 7 to 14 cards, go
to combat and attack with Griselbrand. This will gain you 7 life and allow you
to either continue drawing cards (Generally best if you're only missing one
piece), set yourself up to go off again on your next turn, or sculpt a
disruptive hand that will allow you time to rebuild.

### Infinite Loops

In the event that you can’t find a way to reanimate Emrakul pre-combat, you are
able to _loop_ your deck to either cast Emrakul or repeatedly cast
:card[Collective Brutality] to drain your opponent out 2 life at a time.

To _loop_ your deck:

1. Draw 14 to 21 cards with Griselbrand until you can put :card[Children of
   Korlis] into play (either by casting or reanimating it).
1. Sacrifice Children of Korlis to regain all of the life you’ve lost so far
   this turn (this effect is **cumulative**, so you can gain functionally
   infinite life if you _loop_ Children).
1. Using the life gain from Children, draw your entire library and begin casting
   Dark Rituals to generate a large amount of {B} mana.
1. After casting all of your Rituals, discard :card[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn] to
   shuffle them back in. Make sure you have at least 7 cards between your deck
   and graveyard, so you don't lose the game from decking.
1. At this point you should be able to cast Emrakul and take an extra turn to
   attack for lethal.

If for some reason you’re unable to attack (i.e. there is an :card[Ensnaring
Bridge] in play), you can continue to _loop_ through your deck until your deck +
your graveyard add up to a multiple of 7. From there, cast and sacrifice two
copies of :card[Lotus Petal] for {W}{B}, cast and sacrifice Children of Korlis,
cast Dark Ritual, cast Collective Brutality for its drain mode, then discard
Emrakul using either :card[Thoughtseize] or :card[Cabal Therapy] to shuffle
those 7 cards back into your library. You can now demonstrate a loop that
generates infinite life and infinitely drains your opponent.

Notably, you can’t escalate :card[Collective Brutality] to discard Emrakul, as
this will leave Collective Brutality in your graveyard after the shuffle
resolves, which, as Acclimation puts it in his Tin Fins primer, “does not do the
thing”.

## Mulligans

As a combo deck, Entombsday tends to mulligan well, but requires specific cards
to function. It is able to go as low as 4 cards and still combo on turn 1: a {B}
source, :card[Dark Ritual], :card[Entomb], and a reanimation spell.

In general, you want to leverage the London Mulligan to find the fastest hand
you can in game 1, preferably with protection. You should avoid keeping hands
that just durdle and cast cantrips, as that will give your opponent time to
stabilize and accumulate resources.

When sideboarded into Doomsday, you want to look for hands that cast Doomsday
quickly &mdash; generally before turn 3. This typically means hands that contain
either Doomsday itself or Personal Tutor and the mana to cast it. As with the
game 1 plan, a protection spell is also helpful.

Below are a number of sample starting hands. Would you keep them or mulligan?

:::row
Marsh Flats
Lotus Petal
LED
Dark Ritual
Entomb
Goryo's Vengeance
Force of Will
:::

:::accordion[Click to reveal]
**Keep!**

This hand is better on the draw than the play, since you have a
chance to draw a blue card for Force to protect your combo, but we're not here
to send back a turn 1 combo.
:::

:::row
Underground Sea
Lotus Petal
Polluted Delta
Dark Ritual
Thoughtseize
Preordain
Force of Will
:::

:::accordion[Click to reveal]
**Mulligan**

While this hand definitely plays Magic and is fairly disruptive, it does nothing
to enable your combo. You'll need to find both Entomb (or Griselbrand) and a
reanimation spell.
:::

:::row
Underground Sea
Flooded Strand
Marsh Flats
Entomb
BS
Force of Will
Lim-Dul's Vault
:::

:::accordion[Click to reveal]
**Keep**

Despite being a fairly slow hand, you have Entomb, Protection, and
multiple ways to dig for a reanimation spell. I would lead on the fetch lands
and cast Lim-Dul's vault in my opponent's End Step.
:::

:::row
Polluted Delta
Entomb
Cabal Therapy
Thoughtseize
Goryo's Vengeance
Daze
Force of Will
:::

:::accordion[Click to reveal]
**Keep**

Even though this hand only has one land, it has both combo pieces and
multiple pieces of protection, giving you time to find your second land or a
Dark Ritual.

:::row
Flooded Strand
Lotus Petal
Polluted Delta
Thoughtseize
Goryo's Vengeance
Ponder

:::accordion[Click to reveal]
**Risky Keep**

This hand is a keep, but it's not a great one. You have six
outs between your 4 Entombs and 2 Griselbrands, but there is a chance you cast
your cantrips and whiff.
:::

:::row
Underground Sea
Polluted Delta
Cabal Therapy
Griselbrand
Ponder
Brainstorm
Brainstorm
:::

:::accordion[Click to reveal]
**Risky Keep**

Another risky one. This hand bypasses the need for Entomb by
using Cabal Therapy to _bin_ your Griselbrand, but needs to cantrip toward one
of your six reanimation spells.

## Sideboarding

Despite being a deck with a transformational sideboard plan, Entombsday does not
need to _transform_ in every post-board game. This guide will not tell you which
plan to use in a given matchup, as the Legacy meta is constantly changing and
such a guide would be outdated as soon as it is posted. Instead, it will outline
some general guidelines of which plan is better against which hate pieces.
Strong knowledge of the meta and each archetype's gameplan and common
sideboarding will serve you well here.

When _transforming_, the general sideboard plan is:

| In                       | Out                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 :card[Cavern of Souls] | 1 :card[Children of Korlis] |
| 4 :card[Doomsday]        | 4 :card[Entomb]             |
| 1 :card[Edge of Autumn]  | 2 :card[Goryo's Vengeance]  |
| 2 :card[Personal Tutor]  | 2 :card[Griselbrand]        |
| 1 :card[Shelldock Isle]  | 4 :card[Shallow Grave]      |
| 2 :card[Street Wraith]   |                             |
| 2 :card[Thassa's Oracle] |                             |

Depending on the situation, you are also able to bring in one or both of
:card[Flusterstorm] and :card[Echoing Truth], typically cutting one to two
copies of :card[Preordain] or one :card[Daze] on the draw.

As a general rule, you want to side into Doomsday when you expect permanent hate
pieces such as :card[Leyline of the Void], :card[Dauthi Voidwalker],
:card[Grafdigger's Cage], :card[Narset, Parter of Veils], :card[Hullbreacher],
or :card[Containment Priest]. When expecting stack based hate, such as
:card[Surgical Extraction] or :card[Endurance], it can be better to stay on the
Tin Fins plan, as those are more easily beatable using the instant speed nature
of the Tin Fins combo.

It can also be correct to _transform_ back and forth or stay Tin Fins in game
two and only _transform_ for game 3.

For example, when playing against Delver, you should swap to Doomsday in game
two to try and sneak a win by surprising them. If there is a game three, it's
defensible to use either plan, depending on what graveyard hate you see in game
two. The Tin Fins plan is stronger again Delver in general and can beat a
Surgical Extraction, but if you see permanent hate, such as :card[Grafdigger's
Cage], it may be better to stay on the Doomsday plan.

When playing in paper, you should shuffle all 15 sideboard cards in between each
game, so the opponent doesn't know which gameplan you are on.

In some matchups &mdash; such as Dredge, Hogaak, and Turbo Depths &mdash; where
you expect a fast clock, discard, but no countermagic you can use a hybrid
sideboard plan to create a _two-card monte_-style deck. The idea here is to have
a higher density of _action_ spells, allowing for a higher number of turn 1
combos.

The sideboard plan for this is generally:

| In                       | Out                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 4 :card[Doomsday]        | 4 :card[Force of Will] |
| 1 :card[Edge of Autumn]  | 2 :card[Daze]          |
| 1 :card[Shelldock Isle]  | 2 :card[Preordain]     |
| 2 :card[Street Wraith]   | 1 :card[Griselbrand]   |
| 1 :card[Thassa's Oracle] |                        |

## Common Doomsday Piles

Because the sideboard swap is so clean, Entombsday has very few deck-specific
piles that aren't also available to Turbo Doomsday lists. I would again
recommend reading through the resources available in the [Turbo Doomsday
section](/meandeck/basics) of the Wiki. As a quick reference, some common piles
to know are:

> Pass the Turn OR Cantrip + Land Drop

:::row{variant=PILE}
SI
Em
TO
TO
CoS
:::

This is a variation on the Shelldock + Emrakul pile that provides three win
attempts over multiple turns and plays around things such as :card[Endurance] by
putting very few cards into your graveyard. A few things to note with this pile
are:

1. It can be sped up by a turn if you have access to a cantrip and a land drop.
1. You don't always need to choose Emrakul for the Hideaway trigger. When
   playing against Painter, it is sometimes correct to leave Emrakul in your
   deck and hide Thassa's Oracle under the Shelldock Isle, allowing you to cast
   Oracle before your Draw Step after being milled out.

> Cantrip + {U} + X

:::row{variant=PILE}
BS
LED
Con

:::

This is a common _perfect pile_ when you have 2 total cards in hand. If you have
Brainstorm in hand already and are able to cast it, the pile can be changed to:

> Brainstorm + {U} + X
