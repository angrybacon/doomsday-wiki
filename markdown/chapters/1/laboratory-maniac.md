title: Laboratory Maniac Piles
---

Just to be very clear on the purpose of this section: this does not consider the
use of {{Mental Note}} or {{Unearth}} or any other dead cards that are vulnerable to
graveyard hate. We use Laboratory Maniac together with the cards that we are
already playing.

{{Laboratory Maniac}} serves as an alternative way to win within Doomsday Storm
combo. It is a win condition that doesn't target the opponent (therefore playing
around {{Leyline of Sanctity}}), doesn't involve casting non-creature spells
with converted mana cost 4 or greater against {{Gaddock Teeg}}, and doesn't care
about your opponent's life total. Because Laboratory Maniac is a creature, and
needs to be in play when you draw from an empty library, he is vulnerable to
removal spells like Swords to Plowshares, Lightning Bolt, Pyroblast, and Abrupt
Decay which are all Legacy staples. There are ways to try to play around
removal, but you can't beat everything. The primary purpose of LM is as a wincon
that dodges a lot of incidental Storm hate. It is not a required card, and some
pilots choose not to play it at all, but it has its uses.

Playing a 1-off Laboratory Maniac comes with a number of perks:

- Win through any number of Leyline of Sanctity and/or Gaddock Teeg at very
  little extra cost
- Win through heavy discard with a number of cheap pass-the-turn piles.
- Win even if you can't cast Tendrils of Agony (Meddling Mage, it got hit by
  Surgical Extraction, etc.)
- Win when you lack the resources to build sufficient Storm count for a ToA
  kill

And a couple of downsides:

- Vulnerable to removal
- Can be a completely dead draw pre-Doomsday

## Winning with Laboratory Maniac Using IU

Now let's look into what winning with Laboratory Maniac looks like in Doomsday.
Assuming you have 1 Laboratory Maniac somewhere in your maindeck, the standard
piles are:

> SW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{1UU}} - 4 life

<pile>{{!IU}} {{!CB}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LM}}</pile>

> CB in play, SW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{B}} - 4 life

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!SW}} {{!DR}} {{!LM}}</pile>

> 2 SW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{B}} - 4 life

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!CB}} {{!DR}} {{!LM}}</pile>

Most of these piles speak for themselves. Somehow draw and cast Ideas Unbound
draw CB, LED, SW, cast CB, use SW + LED to draw and cast Laboratory Maniac, tap
CB to draw a card and win the game. Or when you suspect removal and you have
sufficient life left to live another turn, you might pass the turn waiting for
your next upkeep as the last moment for your opponent to cast any removal, to
which you can respond with CB, or win in your draw step. This is a common trick
to beat a single removal spell that needs no modifications to the pile.
Obviously, add {{U}} to the mana cost and subtract 2 life for each SW you don't
have enough life for or when you have another cantrip instead. Many other
variations are possible.

Like with regular Ideas Unbound piles there is a whole range of very cheap piles
that use Brainstorm, Street Wraith, Ideas Unbound, and/or Laboratory Maniac in
hand. Learning all these piles takes some practice but may allow for fast wins,
although not cheaper than a normal tendrils-based wins.

## Winning with Laboratory Maniac Using Infernal Contract

Lists that use IC as their draw spell for piles often eschew Lab Man entirely,
as it isn't as critical for playing through discard, and the piles are not as
efficient. It is possible however, and so for the sake of completeness IC/LM
piles will be touched upon.

> Pre in hand - {{BBB}} + {{UBBB}} + {{U}} or {{B}}

<pile>{{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!LP}} {{!CB}} {{!LM}}</pile>

This pile is fairly straightforward. Cast IC, draw the remaining cards in your
library, cast DR, LP, CB, then LM. Draw with CB to win the game.

The biggest reason this pile isn't used much is because of how expensive it is.
Needing so much colored mana after Doomsday is a steep cost, and IC lists have
other ways of beating discard, and have similarly costed Storm PTT piles. IC
lists generally are built to trade a little flexibility to maximize the
individual power level of its cards, and LM is a perfect example of a card that
provides flexibility while being low power.

## Chromatic Sphere

{{Chromatic Sphere}} can be used to enable Laboratory Maniac piles even when your
opponent is holding creature removal. The key idea is to draw your entire
library and get Chromatic Sphere and Laboratory Maniac in play, then with 1 mana
floating you activate Chromatic Sphere to win the game at mana-ability speed,
without your opponent being able to respond. Abrupt Decay may still be used on
the Chromatic Sphere with Laboratory Maniac on the stack, but after that it's
too late. The same is true for Pyroblast that may still be used on the cantrip
that draws into the pile or the Ideas Unbound. But the good news is Chromatic
Sphere piles do play through Swords to Plowshares and/or Lightning Bolt. Playing
a singleton Chromatic Sphere is not a huge price to pay, because it can
generally also be used to draw into your Doomsday pile or just cantrip while
fixing mana colors.

Most of the time, Chromatic Sphere may be used as a direct replacement for
Conjurer's Bauble within the Doomsday pile. You just have to make sure you
increase the cost of the pile by 1. This 1 extra mana is non-trivial, and this
is why many Doomsday players choose not to play Chromatic Sphere.

## Summary

I hope this gives a good overview for the use of Laboratory maniac.  
Obviously, I have only touched upon the subject and the total number of piles
that may be created is much larger. So things to remember are:

1. LM is an alternate wincon which carries the risk of facing removal, but
   dodges certain kinds of common Storm hate.
2. You need enough mana to cast LM safely as well as a draw effect for when he
   is in play.
4. CS can be used to create a pile that cannot be responded to by removal.
