###### Pre Doomsday

Lands has super strong mana denial, even more in game 2 and 3, and will probably
always win the long game, it can also switch gears very fast thanks to
:card[Dark Depths].

Based on that analysis, a fast Doomsday is the way to go. But when you are
mulliganing, keep in mind how strong countermagic is against their post
sideboard hate pieces.

###### Post Doomsday

You have 3 main objectives post Doomsday:

- Have enough mana to cast :card[Thassa's Oracle]
- Beat :card[Pyroblast]
- Beat :card[Endurance]

Building piles against Lands isn't always easy, and sometimes you have to take
some risks, but if you play to your objectives in the priority listed above, you
should be well set for victory.

You have to learn how to assess your opponent posibilities, that's not something
you'll learn reading this guide. With more experience you'll be able to refine this
skill. Below are a number of relevant interactions in the matchup:

- Fetches are great to play around mana denial. You can *hide* you
  mana-producing lands behind them while thinning your deck
- Free countermagic is your best tool against every form of hate spells. From
  :card[Endurance] over :card[Choke] to :card[Sphere of Resistance]
- Artifact mana is very good when you want to end the game fast and you know
  they don't have ways to mess with it
- :card[Cavern of Souls] is an easy out to :card[Pyroblast]
- Bounce Spells are the way to go to beat a fast Marit Lage.
