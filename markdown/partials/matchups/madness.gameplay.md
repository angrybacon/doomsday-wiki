###### Pre Doomsday

Similar to Hogaak it's a race or die matchup, but Madness has zero interaction
other than creature removal. They just slam and hope it's enough, and we do the
same.

:card[Lion's Eye Diamond] is a very scary card in their deck, that leads to very
explosive turns. It should be countered unless you think you can ignore their
clock and are winning the next turn. Try to evaluate how much damage it
represents.

:card[Daze] should be used with care. Only use it if the setback of bouncing
your own land isn't too big and doesn't cost you the opportunity of a same turn
kill with :card[Brainstorm] as you untap.

Should they have :card[Mindbreak Trap] in hand post sideboard, it's often pretty
obvious, because it's very hard for them to keep interaction up while playing
out their threats.

###### Post Doomsday

Their only ways to put hasty threats onto the board are :card[Vengevine] or
:card[Anger] with a Mountain. This makes it very easy to predict their damage
and whether it is safe to pass the turn.
