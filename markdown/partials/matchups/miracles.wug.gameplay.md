###### Pre Doomsday

One layer of protection is usually enough to resolve a Doomday in game 1 but in
post-board games it's advised to play more carefully.

Many sideboarded games are defined by hatebears from their side, because they
often don't have enough countermagic to fight Doomsday on the stack. They have
to try to lock us out of the game or rely on the pressure of their creatures.

###### Post Doomsday

Beating countermagic is not your only problem, their hatebears and answers to
Oracle's trigger will be the main reason you lose games.

After you resolved Doomsday everything is about beating :card[Endurance], and
against some newer lists :card[Dress Down]. They are their main ways to beat
:card[Thassa's Oracle]'s trigger. But there are many ways to play around these
answers. In game 1 you have to rely on countermagic and discard, but in game 2
and 3 you'll often use a sideboard package, like :card[Em] + :card[SI]. These
sideboard packages often come with their own weaknesses, like :card[Teferi, Time
Raveler] or :card[Back to Basics], but are still better than just slamming 1
Oracle into a prepared opponent.
