###### Pre Doomsday

Against Death and Taxes resolving an early Doomsday is the safest way to win.
Mulliganing for a turn 1 or turn 2 Doomsday is a good starting point.

Longer games are their only reliable way to win. They deny our mana and hinder
our cantrips.

Game 1 they usually have no way to interact with your Doomsday on the stack, so
you can just slam as early as possible.

In post board games play around :card[Mindbreak Trap] when it's reasonable and
keep countermagic ready to fight :card[Deafening Silence]. Beware the vial on 3
which can either represent :card[Flickerwisp] or :card[Aven Mindcensor].

###### Post Doomsday

It's very important to keep in mind, that your mana is your biggest weakness and
that you can not rely on cyclers as tool to work through your pile.

There are many possible piles, but one of the easiest, most tested and pretty
:card[Surgical Extraction] proof pile is Fetchland, Fetchland, Thassa's Oracle,
Land, Land. It gives you the necessary mana, thins the pile and goes down to 0
cards to play around :card[Solitude]. All without cyclers or cantrips that get
stuck in your hand against :card[Spirit of the Labyrinth] and :card[Phyrexian
Revoker]. It's also very customizable. For instance if they already have some
pressure built up, add a :card[Massacre] or a removal spell for :card[Stoneforge
Mystic] to stay safe from :card[Kaldra Compleat].

When we are already talking about Kaldra Compleat, remember it has haste and
represents 5 damage for 2 Mana out of a Stoneforge Mystic.
