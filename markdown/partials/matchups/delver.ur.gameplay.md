###### Pre Doomsday

Historically, blue *tempo* archetypes have always been the hardest to fight
against. Playing a longer game against a deck with strong pressure and heavy
protection is also challenging and resolving a Doomsday before they establish
both a clock and amass permission is key.

Hands with turn 1 Doomsday are always great, especially on the play. After
Modern Horizons 2 many Delver players started to cut some numbers of :card[Force
of Negation], some don't even play them maindeck. This makes our turn 1
Doomsdays safer options than they used to. The counterpart is that with each
turn passing without resolving a Doomsday, their :card[Dragon's Rage Channeler]
finds them the permission they want while presenting a very fast clock given how
easily it enables :card[Murktide Regent].

###### Post Doomsday

The post Doomsday game against UR Delver is very tricky. You often have to take
risks to resolve Oracle without giving the Delver player too much time to look
for answers or straight up kill you with damage.

Of course you would prefer to always build [Brainstorm
piles](/meandeck/brainstorm) and never pass the turn, but that's not always
possible. Discard are also an efficient way of clearing the way for piles that
rely on :card[Lion's Eye Diamond] where countermagic is not ideal. Here comes
the ugly part: you can't beat everything a Delver deck possibly has. Even with
stock lists. You'll have to learn how to assess the situation and plan
accordingly. That's an important skill in every matchup, but against Delver it's
crucial.
