###### Pre Doomsday

Due to its *toolbox* nature, you can expect various threats from your opponent
but mostly in the form of hatebears. Cards like :card[Meddling Mage] will slow
you down by naming Doomsday itself. If your hand cannot beat a turn 2 Meddling
Mage off :card[Cavern of Souls] or turn 3 off :card[Aether Vial], consider
mulliganing more aggressively or countering the Vial.

###### Post Doomsday

Passing the turn multiple times can be risky due to their permanent-based
maindeck *hate*. Even in sideboarded games, :card[Massacre] is not a guaranteed
hit as they can often withhold their Plains and still deploy hatebears.

They also have multiple ways to reduce your devotion to {U} at instant speed so
watch out for active Vials and :card[Solitude]. Non-exhaustive list of relevant
creatures they can *flash* in:

- Off Vial on 2: :card[Gilded Drake] and :card[Ethersworn Canonist].
  :card[Meddling Mage] naming Oracle in response to your draw effect can be
  back-breaking
- Off Vial on 3: :card[Flickerwisp], :card[Skyclave Apparition], :card[Spell
  Queller]. :card[Recruiter of the Guard] can represent a new threat if they
  have a second Vial or simply :card[Solitude]
- Off Vial on 4: :card[Palace Jailer] and :card[Venser, Shaper Savant]
