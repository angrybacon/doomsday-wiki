###### Pre Doomsday

Overall Esper Vial is not a very fast deck. It needs some time to set up
pressure. Most of its cards try to accumulate value and overwhelm you in the 
long run. In Game 1 Esper Vial shoudln't be a huge problem. Yes, it plays
Force of Will and Teferi, Time Raveler, but if you can put Doomsday on the
stack before turn 3 you should have no problem resolving it. One counterspell
from you is enopugh to push through most of the time. Daze is especially good
in the matchup, because they have to use their mana in their early turns to
play to the board, similar to DnT.
Due to its *toolbox* nature, you can expect various threats from your opponent
but mostly in the form of hatebears. Cards like :card[Meddling Mage] will slow
you down by naming Doomsday itself.
Post board many Esper Vial lists board in 4 Force of Negations. They are still
not a control deck, but now we need resources to beat atleast 2 Forces.
As a general advice, their mana can be very shaky, so preventing them from
setting up a Aether Vial doesn't just saves you from uncounterable Meddling Mages
but can also disrupt their whole gameplan. No Vial also forces them to play out
Plains to enable their most important cards.


###### Post Doomsday

Your gameplan after resolving Doomsday is very dependent on pressure and their
possibilities to set up hatebears. If they have no pressure you can build a
very slow pile and keep your removal and counterspells ready for the
important threats and hatebears. In games where the pressure is already high
when you resolve Doomsday, you either have to heavily rely on mass removal
like Massacre, or build a really fast pile and take some risks.

A small but important hint: When your opponent keeps up 4 Mana or has a vial
on for be wary of Venser, Shaper Savant. It can bounce your Thassas Oracle
on the stack even when it's casted with Cavern of Souls.
