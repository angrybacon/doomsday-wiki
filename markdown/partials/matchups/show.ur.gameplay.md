###### Pre Doomsday

Sneak and Show is one of our harder combo matchups, but we should still be
slightly favoured.

Both ours and their deck share many similarities, there are however 2 small but
important differences. We have better fast mana in the form of :card[Dark
Ritual] and we only really need one card to combo while they need 2 or 3. This
means we need less resources to combo and we can use cantrips to look for
protection rather than combo cards.

In games where you can't combo safely in turn 1 or 2 the game can evolve into a
staredown while both players dig for interaction. Discard can be very helpful in
situations like this. But be careful, if you play a list with less cantrips,
they will sculpt their hand better than you most of the time.

In post board games they will try and get you with :card[Blood Moon] effects.
Try to keep that in mind.

###### Post Doomsday

If you have to pass the turn after resolving Doomsday, try to do so with
available draw effects still in hand. This makes it risky for them to resolve
:card[Show and Tell] on their turn. That way, only :card[Sneak Attack] can kill
you in the same turn.
