###### Pre Doomsday

The Epic Storm or TES for short is the slower combo deck in matchup. It plays no
real interaction other than silence effects, which are mostly protection for
their own combo turn. So your Doomsday is always safe.

TES is pretty good in playing through countermagic and is able to reset hands
with Echo of Eons. Be carefull with your countermagic, try not to waste it. It's
good to have a feeling for how far they are away from a kill, to assess the
situation.

###### Post Doomsday

Pass the turn piles are very risky against Storm decks, because the lifeloss of
:card[Doomsday] puts them in the very good position of not needing a high Storm
count. With :card[Burning Wish] for :card[Grapeshot] they can easily amass
enough damage without ever needing to reach 4 mana for :card[Tendrils of Agony].
Only pass the turn if you know they cannot kill you. With :card[Burning Wish]
for :card[Grapeshot].

Since some lists started to play white, be careful, they can cast :card[Orim's
Chant] to *mill you out*. They just cast their silence effect on your upkeep or
in response to your cycle effects rendering you unable to even cast the oracle.

There are many ways to play around this. Countermagic is the more obvious way,
but you can also for example use your instant draw effects in response to your
Oracle trigger. Traditional silence effects don't prevent you from cycling
cards. Only :card[Abeyance] does, but sees next to no play.
