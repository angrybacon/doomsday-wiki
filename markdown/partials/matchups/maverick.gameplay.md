###### Pre Doomsday

The matchup against Maverick plays pretty similar to the Death and Taxes
matchup, with a small but important difference, :card[Green Sun's Zenith]. It
gives them the opportunity to find their silver bullets very easily. Since there
are no real stock Maverick lists at the moment, expect every possible sideboard target also in the maindeck.

Some lists play :card[Dark Depths] as an alternative win condition, but it's not
super common and the Dark Depths lines are all very telegraphed and easy to
spot.

###### Post Doomsday

Like against most green decks :card[Endurance] is the only real threat to your
easier and quick piles.

That's why it's super important to build safe piles. As long as you resolved
Doomsday early, there is no reason to get fancy.

Fetches are strong against :card[Wasteland] and :card[Collector Ouphe], so try
to stay away from petals as your mana sources for :card[Thassa's Oracle].
