###### Pre Doomsday

Since :card[Allosaurus Shepherd] removed all interaction in this matchup, it's
only about racing and countering a :card[Thoughtseize] or :card[Deafening
Silence] when necessary. But should you have the possibility to counter something
without losing too much speed, it's often advised to slow them down by denying
them important combo cards like :card[Elvish Visionary] or :card[Heritage
Druid].

They can set up very fast kills, either with Allosaurus Shepherd's activated
ability or with :card[Natural Order]. Be careful and try to finish the game as
fast as possible.

###### Post Doomsday

Pass the turn piles can be a tad risky due to their explosiveness. Especially
turn 3 or later. Try to build fast piles.

In the past some Elves lists played :card[Endurance] or :card[Crop Rotation] for
:card[Ipnu Rivulet], but as long as they stay absent from sideboards, you only
have to play around :card[Collector Ouphe].
