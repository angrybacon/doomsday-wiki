###### Pre Doomsday

Do **not** keep hands without countermagic. You'll need it to protect your own
combo and fighting off theirs. With all their discard effects one free counter
is often not enough. The only reason to keep hands without protection are turn 1
kills and even then, those can be slowed down with Chancellor.

When fighting against their combo, try to always to counter the :card[Entomb]
effects, without a good target their reanimation spells are mitigated. And as a
little side note, most lists play only 8 slots dedicated to bin creatures into
the graveyard and 12 reanimation spells.

###### Post Doomsday

The scariest creatures they can reanimate post Doomsday are :card[Iona, Shield
of Emeria] and :card[Ashen Rider], so try to be careful with your lands as they
can be dealt with. :card[Lotus Petal]s are safe against Ashen Rider, but can be
discarded. Iona will just end the game, and you can't do anything about that 99%
of the time.
