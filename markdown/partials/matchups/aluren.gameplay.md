###### Pre Doomsday

Aluren is a pretty slow combo deck. These days white seems to be preferred over
the {U}{B}{G} lists. To go off they need at least 4 mana, :card[Aluren] and a
way to draw their deck or directly :card[Acererak the Archlich]. This should
give you enough time to find Doomsday and set up a safe kill.

Resolving Doomsday should not be too hard, Aluren only plays 4 Force of Will
main and 2 Force of Negation in the sideboard. That's often not enough when they
also try to set up their own kill. In game 1, one counterspell is often enough
to force your Doomsday through. In game 2 you want enough interaction to beat at
least 2 Force effects from their side and try to keep an eye out for
:card[Opposition Agent] and :card[Hullbreacher]. The white lists also have
access to hatebears so bringing removal might be warranted.

###### Post Doomsday

Many lists play :card[Endurance], like most green decks in the current meta, so
prepare to play around at least one copy.

If they fought over your Doomsday, it might mean they don't have enough
resources to go off anymore, but that is not always the case, especially since
:card[Acererak the Archlich] joined the format. Should they still be able to go
off and you have enough cyclers in hand to cycle to Thassa's Oracle, be careful
when casting it off :card[Aluren]. It's better to cast it when their combo
creature is still on the stack, else they can react and combo off again in
response.
