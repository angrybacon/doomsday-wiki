###### Pre Doomsday

This will be a short one. Just cast Doomsday as soon as possible and play around
possible :card[Mindbreak Trap]s in sideboarded games.

Some lists play the :card[Dark Depths] combo. Like in any Dark Depths deck,
their plays to create a 20/20 are very telegraphed.

###### Post Doomsday

Realistically speaking they only have one card to interact with you,
:card[Endurance]. You should always have enough time for a pile that beats
Endurance and even plays around :card[Mindbreak Trap].

From time to time you'll come across a Post opponent with curious sideboard
choices. This can happen in smaller metas like that of your local FNM. Cards
such as :card[Mikokoro, Center of the Sea] or :card[Nimble Obstructionist] can
_get_ you if you're not prepared.
