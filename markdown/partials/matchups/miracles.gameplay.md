**Pre Doomsday**

You can play a much slower game against Bant Miracles. They don't have any early
threats and have to respect Daze. In Game 1 one layer of protection is often
enough to resolve a Doomday but in post board games it's adviced to play more
carefuly.

Many sideboarded games are defined by hatebears from their side, because they
often don't have enough countermagic to just fight Doomsday on the stack. They
have to try to lock us out of the game or rely on the pressure of their
creatures.

**Post Doomsday**

After you resolved Doomsday everything is about beating :card[Endurance], and
against some newer lists :card[Dress Down]. They are their main way to beat
:card[Thassa's Oracle]. But there are many ways to play around these answers. In
Game 1 you have to rely on countermagic and discard, but in Game 2 and 3 you'll
often use a sideboard package, like :card[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn] +
:card[Shelldock Isle]. These sideboard packages often come with their own
weaknesses, like :card[Teferi, Time Raveler] or :card[Back to Basics], but are
still better than just slamming 1 Oracle into a prepared opponent.
