###### Pre Doomsday

Jeskai Ragavan is still a somewhat unrefined archetype at the moment. There are
many builds out there, from tempo style lists, over midrange variants, to more
controlling builds.

The matches against this deck play pretty similar to the UR Delver matchup, but
Jeskai Ragavan often has a weaker damage backup, because many lists play less or
no :card[Lightning Bolt]s combined with less threats but more protection.

###### Post Doomsday

The post Doomsday part of the game is often defined by the variant you play
against or you think you play against. It's very important to try to identify
your opponent's role and adapt to new information.
