###### Pre Doomsday

Respect their turn 3 bomb. Best case it's a :card[Teferi, Time Raveler] who
_only_ shuts down your countermagic and makes resolving Doomsday more difficult.
Worst case it's a :card[Narset, Parter of Veils] who can find them 2 extra
pieces of permission, shut down your cantrips as you sculpt and slow your pile
to the point where their card selection becomes better than yours as they sculpt
a hand of their own.

And by _respect_ their turn 3 bomb, I mean _race_ their turn 3 bomb.

###### Post Doomsday

Unannounced :card[Narset, Parter of Veils] and :card[Hullbreacher] can transform
easy wins in a very slow death especially if you were relying on cantrips to
shorten your pile or worse, LED piles. Winning before the turn 3 is a good way
to ignore both Narset and Hullbreacher.

Prepare for :card[Day's Undoing]. If they're on that, all it takes is having 7
cards or less combined in graveyard, hand and pile to lose the game. An easy way
to cheat on cards is by putting extra cards in your graveyard with :card[Day's
Undoing] still on the stack eg. cracking a fetchland failing to find, cycling an
:card[Edge of Autumn], cracking a :card[Lotus Petal]. This is similar to all
_Timetwister_ effects like :card[Echo of Eons] from Storm archetypes. Once
you've survived your draw step, it becomes trivial to resolve the Oracle with 8
cards in hand including most of your pile if not all.

You should also prepare for :card[Torpor Orb] when you can but playing around a
one-of from the opponent, especially early in the game is not usually worth it.
