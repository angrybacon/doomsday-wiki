###### Pre Doomsday

The Hogaak matchup can be pretty tricky, because they have two ways to kill you,
either with damage or with mill. They don't even have to completely mill your 60
cards, the simple threat to mill at instant speed is often enough to make a kill
with Doomsday impossible.

There are two iterations of Hogaak, a {B}{R}{G} version and {U}{B}{G} one. The
latter is scarier by far thanks to :card[Hedron Crab].

Speed is the only way to beat Hogaak, they are just too explosive to give them
time and you really don't want to play against Hedron Crab. You have to be very
careful when you pass the turn after Doomday resolved. :card[Bloodghasts] can
threaten lethal very easily so try to evaluate the damage they can put out as
you pass the turn.

Other than :card[Surgical Extraction], they don't play any sideboard hate for
Doomsday. Countermagic is still paramount to keep them in check and protect your
combo.

###### Post Doomsday

Because Hogaak plays no cards to interact with you on the stack, resolving
Doomsday is easy in itself. Playing around crabs and fetchlands however can be
very difficult, especially when passing the turn where they might have access to
2 fetchland activations or worse, a second crab.

They can also attempt to shuffle your pile thanks to :card[Assassin's Trophy].
It is a *may* clause but ponder whether you can part with a land during your
turn.

If you have the resources, try building [Brainstorm piles](/meandeck/brainstorm)
as they can *fix* your pile after a crab trigger or Altar activation(s). Should
you have to pass the turn, make sure you have answers at your disposal.
