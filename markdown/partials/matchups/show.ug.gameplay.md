###### Pre Doomsday

OmniTell is a lot slower than its sister Sneak and Show, since it plays only
:card[Show and Tell] and no Sneak Attack. It also plays only 4 counterspells
most of the time. That's overall very positive for us. Not much protection is
needed and we have time to set up, but a lost counter war over Doomsday, can
have harsh consequences if they tutor :card[Surgical Extraction] from their
sideboard with :card[Cunning Wish].

###### Post Doomsday

You can build safe piles that either use their own Show and Tell to put Thassa's
Oracle into play or just cast it off :card[Cavern of Souls] if you have access
to it in your list.

Some OmniTell lists play :card[Trickbind] in their sideboard. Try to use discard
spells to get rid of it if you suspect it.
