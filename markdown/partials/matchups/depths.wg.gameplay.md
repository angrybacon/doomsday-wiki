###### Pre Doomsday

The matchup plays pretty similar to the Maverick matchup, but you have to focus
more on speed. GW Depths can set up a pretty early Dark Depths Combo with its
fast mana and strong tutors, but they are not really a fast combo deck. Most
hands can't kill you reliably through countermagic in the early turns of the
game.

They have no counterplay against you in game 1 besides pressure and a bit of
mana denial with Wasteland, so just slam early. In game 2 and 3 they probably
bring in more mana denial like :card[Collector Ouphe] or :card[Choke] and some
basic combo hate with :card[Deafening Silence]. Still, nothing a fast Doomsday
can't beat.

###### Post Doomsday

For your pile, evaluate their pressure and build accordingly, but try to play
around :card[Endurance] if possible.
