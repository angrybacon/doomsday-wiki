Welcome to the Doomsday Wiki!

The Doomsday Wiki is intended to be the most complete and up to date work on how
to cast the card named Doomsday in the Legacy format of Magic: the Gathering.

There is actually much more to how to play the deck, but understanding how to
cast the namesake card of the deck is a pretty big piece of the puzzle. This
document is specifically not a *primer* as you often see for other decks in
Legacy, because primers generally become outdated rather quickly and are more
about card choices, decklists, sideboard plans, and so on. The Doomsday Wiki is
there to help people to really understand how the deck works and can win in
various scenarios.

The Doomsday Wiki focuses on the theory behind the piles. How to build them,
when to build them, why the pile is built up like that, how to play around
stuff, how to sequence your spells correctly, and so on.

We have three main variants represented on here that you can access resources
for on the left hand sidebar.

**DDFT** (Doomsday Fetchland Tendrils) is the closest to historical lists.
Although it adopts the current usage of Thassa's Oracle these decks tend to also
have access to secondary Storm plans using cards like Burning Wish, Echo of Eons
and Tendrils of Agony. They also prefer proactive protection such as Duress over
being able to run reactive counter magic.

**DDEFT** (Doomsday Experimental Frenzy Tendrils) is now an outdated style. This
was the main variant available post Gitaxian Probe ban and pre-printing of
Thassa's Oracle. These lists use Experimental Frenzy as a card advantage engine
and win condition in tandem with Doomsday.

**Meandeck Doomsday** is the primary deck variant that is having previously
unprecedented success since the printing of Thassa's Oracle. Meandeck Doomsday
uses counter magic like Force of Will and Daze to play a controlling game before
ending the game with Doomsday. The moniker *Meandeck* is explained in this
article [here](/articles/2020/03/12/pretty-mean-deck/).

If you are new to the archetype then please check out the [FAQs
