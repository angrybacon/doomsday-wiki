[Doomsday Discord](https://discord.gg/vajvFXt)

The Doomsday Wiki is intended to be the most complete and up to date work on how
to cast the card named Doomsday in the Legacy format of Magic: the Gathering.

There is actually much more to how to play the deck, but understanding how to
cast the namesake card of the deck is a pretty big piece of the puzzle. This
document is specifically not a *primer* as you often see for other decks in
Legacy, because primers generally become outdated rather quickly and are more
about card choices, decklists, sideboard plans, and so on. The Doomsday Wiki is
there to help people to really understand how the deck works and can win in
various scenarios.

The Doomsday Wiki focuses on the theory behind the piles. How to build them,
when to build them, why the pile is built up like that, how to play around
stuff, how to sequence your spells correctly, and so on.
