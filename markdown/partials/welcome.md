Welcome to the Doomsday Wiki!

The Doomsday Wiki is intended to be the most complete and up to date work on how
to cast the card named Doomsday in the Legacy format of *Magic: the Gathering*.

There is actually much more to how to play the deck, but understanding how to
cast the namesake card of the deck is a pretty big piece of the puzzle. This is
specifically not a *primer* as you often see for other decks in Legacy, because
primers generally become outdated rather quickly and are more about card
choices, decklists, sideboard plans, and so on. The Doomsday Wiki is there to
help people to really understand how the deck works and can win in various
scenarios.

We have three main variants represented on here that you can access resources
for on the left hand sidebar.

**Meandeck Doomsday** is the primary deck variant that is having previously
unprecedented success since the printing of Thassa's Oracle. Meandeck Doomsday
uses countermagic like Force of Will and Daze to play a controlling game before
ending the game. The moniker *Meandeck* is explained in [this
article][pretty-mean-deck].

**DDFT** (Doomsday Fetchland Tendrils) is the closest to historical lists.
Although it adopts the current usage of Thassa's Oracle these decks tend to also
have access to secondary Storm plans using cards like Burning Wish, Echo of Eons
and Tendrils of Agony. They also prefer proactive protection such as Duress over
being able to run reactive counter magic.

**DDEFT** (Doomsday Experimental Frenzy Tendrils) is now an outdated style. This
was the main variant available post Gitaxian Probe ban and pre-printing of
Thassa's Oracle. These lists use Experimental Frenzy as a card advantage engine
and win condition in tandem with Doomsday.
