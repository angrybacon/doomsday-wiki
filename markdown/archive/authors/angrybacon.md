Part *Spike*, part *Timmy*, but mostly *Johnny*. Playing exclusively Legacy
where I typically try and pilot very weird synergies. I like to make heads turn
with weird deck constructions putting Dryad Arbor into play off an Aether Vial
or copying their Song of the Dryad'd Jace with my Vesuva... Naturally, Doomsday
feels right at home.

I made this very Wiki, with the Legacy community in mind. I hope the community
can keep helping this project grow like it has since its early sprouts.
