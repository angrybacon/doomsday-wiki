## Doishy

I am a combo-control player at heart, heralding from Bristol UK with a love for
Doomsday, Omnitell variants and their like (RiP Underworld Breach). Basically
anything degenerate that can also run Force of Will! I've been playing magic
since OG Ravnica, Legacy since OG Innistrad and have an irrational hatred for
Delver of Secrets.

I love building communities and help run [local events](http://swawlq.com) for
Legacy staples where needed. I collect copies of Doomsday signed by Doomsday
players and, if you would class yourself as one, I would love to add your
signature / copy to my collection! Feel free to fire me a message on the Discord
Server.

I'm also a cat person. :3
