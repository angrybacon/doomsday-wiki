## UnOrthodoxBird

Obsessed with fringe Storm variants, I've been playing Doomsday for almost 2
years now, originally starting post Gitaxian Probe ban with a variant relying on
Burning Wish and Draw4's. While I generally deck hop, Doomsday has been one deck
I've been unable to put down. My goal is to make most weird Storm variants work
in my local scene and, once time permits, venture to larger events with Doomsday
in tow. I currently rotate between DDFT, High Tide, and Bizarro Stormy in my
local scene and TES at larger events. Outside of MtG I am a tax accountant with
interests in board games and going to vineyards with my fiancée.
