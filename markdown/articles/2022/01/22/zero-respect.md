## Preface

First of all I guess happy new year everyone!

I hope you're all safe and well going into 2022 xxx

The Wiki author team has generally been against the writing of specific
sideboard guides as are often seen across the magic community. Sideboard guides
can be very helpful in allowing players to quickly pick up decks they may have
seen from other pilots that they enjoy or provide a quick starter if they do not
have time to work out the nuances of a deck themselves. However we believe in a
more _teach a man to fish_ approach whereby we encourage people to build their
deck and sideboard from the ground up and work out what works best for each
pilot. There is also a huge amount of potential variation that can be applied to
the archetype these days with lists often changing speed, style, colours and all
manner of things based on pilot experience, preference and metagame.

It's because of this that we present our [sideboard
chapter](/meandeck/sideboard) as a series of guiding principles instead of a
rigid _+x/-y_ format since we cannot account for every decklist and what might
be very common one day could very well become obsolete the next. Even so, there
are definitely advantages to having at least one example guide if nothing else
to try to promote people to write and discover their own plans. I personally
think everyone should have a go at mapping their plans for each matchup at least
once, even if you don't follow it perfectly or change your mind completely at
least you have gone through and worked out each slot and whether it is justified
to hold its place. It also means that you become more aware of the roles each
card has so that you can become flexible vs. the unknown.

Because of the demand for it as a one-off article I thought I would provide my
own sideboard guide. This is not a guide I have properly written up before but
it will be a good exercise for me as well to write it. This guide will also try
to explain the reasoning behind some of the decisions and thus discuss both the
main deck configuration and my own style of play alongside it. It very well may
not be super applicable for you because of how you prefer to play (or because no
one else plays my deck) but hopefully it will encourage you to have a go working
out your own plans!

## Biases

The first things I should write about before even presenting the decklist is
about my own playstyle and personal bias towards the deck. These are the core
principles behind why I build it like I do and are based on my own play
experience and ideals. It might be worth before having a go at this yourself to
work out some key points that you feel about your deck so as to understand what
you want from it.

### I Like Playing Combo-Control

This one is self explanatory. One of the best things about the current
iterations of Doomsday is I get to run both all my combo staples :card[DR],
:card[LED], :card[DD] alongside things like :card[FoW] with a full cantrip suite
to boot! This means I can have the choice to play the aggressive role (without
all that nasty combat maths that hurts my tiny brain) or pivot to take it slow a
bit more until I want to win. This flexibility is something I value highly.

### I See Doomsday as a Mono Blue Deck that Happens to Require {B}{B}{B}

This one is a funny one and one I have been citing since Oracle was printed.
People often look at me funny when I say this however it is definitely true. The
deck pre-Doomsday relies on being able to cantrip, cast counter magic and do the
things that blue decks like to do. Post-Doomsday all you need are some draw
effects and the ability to make {U}{U}. It's just that awkward bit in the middle
where you need to find {B}{B}{B} to actually cast Doomsday itself (and on
occasion firing off a discard spell). This is why in regards to manabase I prize
{U} over {B} and run a basic Island. It's also why every fetchable land in my
deck has the Island subtype and my fetch configuration is Island-centric.

### I Hate Relying on the Top of my Deck

The games that I lose which annoy me the most are the ones where it has gone a
bit long and I am waiting for _that one card_ to win. The worst is when _that
one card_ is literally any card with the text "draw a card" on it. Often it's
vs. UGx control piles and I have Doomsday, mana, protection in abundance but the
gamestate is such where I cannot do a PTT pile so all I need is any method to
dig into the pile post resolution. These are the losses that stick in my mind
even more so than the turn 1 blowouts with :card[Blood Moon] against Moon Stompy
or the "needed to dodge :card[Daze] one time" vs. Delver. As a result I run as
many cantrips as I can reasonably fit into the deck whilst still trying to
retain the elements of the _Turbo_ style. This is why you will see some number
of :card[Pre] in the deck alongside :card[Con] and the normal cantrip and cycler
suite.

### I Tend to be Fast to Cast Doomsday, But Slow After it Resolves

This was something I hadn't thought of before until the lovely _Francobolli_
pointed it out in response to one of my [YouTube video
uploads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlZ9mnCRFgQ):

> \@Doishy your play style is very much on the aggressive side to cast doomsday
> and then maybe conservative making the piles. It is good to see both those
> perspectives.

In this I am trying to slam Doomsday as fast as possible but will often build a
pile that passes 1-3 more turns (sometimes the full five) after it resolves.
This is why I like having Daze, why I run 3 :card[PT] and why I am almost the
complete _Turbo_ shell but don't go full ham on cycling effects and multiple
:card[Consider]s. It's also why I run :card[CoS] in the main.

### I am Here to Disrespect Delver

I have tried in the past to dedicate a lot of sideboard slots for beating URx
Delver decks before and I realised that the games I was winning against them was
because of tight play, a little bit of luck and mostly my main deck tools. As a
result I decided to run no dedicated Delver sideboard slots and instead just
work out a solid plan from the other tools I was using anyways. This is the one
matchup I pretty much never deviate from my plan on and I am happy to take my
30-40% win rate against them where I can.

### I Like Having Access to a Toolbox

You will notice through the guide I often do not take out :card[Con], :card[DA],
:card[IU], :card[LED] and I almost always leave in 2 cycler effects. This is
because I like having the options to access the instant win Deep Analysis pile,
fast :card[BS] piles and resilient Ideas Unbound piles. Even if they seem poor
in a matchup, simply having them available to you I think is important because
they grant you the most flexibility post Doomsday to tailor the pile to your
needs. In all likelihood I should probably cut some number of them more often
but I don't... \:D

### I am Slow to Make Changes to my Deck

I mostly play in paper (and then online when the MTGO all access passes come
out). I will always run a 75 for a few events to get a feel for what I like or
not and even then almost only ever change 1-2 cards max. Like at the time of
writing this I am thinking of changing one sideboard card and that is after
about 2 months of playing with the current 75. I think it's important to truly
get a feel for what you are running and to try not to make knee-jerk decisions
based on one set of bad beats or a single event.

## The Decklist

Here is the decklist itself. You can see already some of the construction
thoughts that went into it from what was said above. It's a _Turbo_ list so has
3 :card[PT] in alongside 4 cycling effects to enable swift access to piles. It
has :card[Con], :card[DA] and :card[IU] all in to enable the faster pile
building. All lands are Islands so the fetchlands can be perfectly spread out
for the corner case :card[Pithing Needle] effect naming. There is also a
maindeck :card[Watery Grave] to act as a 5th :card[Underground Sea]. It has 4
:card[LP]s to help speed things up and fix mana. It runs the full set of Forces,
Dazes and has 1 :card[CoS] and 1 :card[PoN] for pile building alongside two
maindeck discard spells as additional protection. It also runs 2 :card[Pre]
alongside the normal cantrip suite as extra slow fitlering.

::decklist{path=2022/01/zero-respect}

As you can see the maindeck is entirely {U}{B} (despite what :card[EoA]
pretends). This means we have a lot of flexibility in being able to add splash
colours, if, as and when we need them. The sideboard is designed to offer
flexibility in many matchups with certain tools acting as silver bullets in
others. I like including a splash colour in my sideboard because I personally
see it as a free addition and, at the moment, that splash is {R} however I have
done {G} and full 4 colours before in the past. I have also dabbled with {W} but
not in the same shell as this.

The last major change I made to the list was removing a :card[Tropical Island]
from the main, replacing it with the :card[Watery Grave] and taking 2 :card[VoS]
from the side and replacing them with a 2nd :card[Flusterstorm] and 2nd
:card[Pyroblast]. From testing, although I liked having access to {G} and Veil,
I had faced many instances where Flusterstorm was either equal to, or better in
certain circumstances. I also wanted to try a third blast effect as in some of
the fair blue matchups I was wanting to see them more often.

I will quickly go through the sideboard cards and give a quick summary of their
general/expected roles and the justification for having them.

- 1 :card[Chain of Vapor]: Catch all permanent answer that is easy on the mana.
  Helps deal with most things other than Chalice on 1 and even then most of the
  time that can be ignored. Can also allow the bouncing of your own Oracle to
  recast in a pinch.
- 2 :card[Flusterstorm]: Shines vs. other spell-based combos, helps disrupt
  cheaper interaction and allows us to force our combo through opposing
  protection. A very useful tool for multiple fair and unfair matchups.
- 4 :card[FoN]: Acting as both combo protection from those faster than us and to
  complement the Chain by preventing things like :card[Blood Moon],
  :card[Chalice of the void], :card[Trinisphere] etc. from landing onto the
  battlefield. A very versatile and mana efficient card. Sometimes can be
  over-boarded.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
CoV
Flusterstorm
FoN
:::

- 1 :card[Massacre]: One of the more specialist tools. This helps deal with a
  myriad of hatebear style creatures in a very mana efficient way and can be
  easily found through casting Doomsday. Normally used in non-{U} fair matchups
  but occasionally can be brought in to fight off :card[Meddling Mage] or
  similar from fair {U} decks.
- 2 :card[Pyroblast]: Catch all in {U} matchups as protection, disruption and
  removal. Anyone who plays Legacy knows how effective these can be in the right
  matchup.
- 1 :card[Red Elemental Blast]: It's like Pyroblast but spelt differently. This
  is here to simply diversify my blast effects for small percentage points and
  niche corner cases (although I have had people Surgical them before!).

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Massacre
Pyroblast
REB
:::

- 1 :card[Surgical Extraction]: Part of the anti-graveyard package. This
  provides soft turn 0 protection against decks looking to abuse the graveyard.
  Sometimes I also look to bring it in for the mirror.
- 1 :card[TO]: The second Oracle is a very versatile tool. It allows you to pile
  with two of them giving multiple chances at resolving it and allowing you to
  go up to a devotion of 4 which helps bypass things like :card[Endurance]. It
  also increases your pseudo blue card count for Force pitch purposes by +2
  (because you now have 2 cards in the deck eligibile to pitch whereas before
  you could never pitch your lone Oracle). It also blocks :card[Ragavan, Nimble
  Pilferer] and :card[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben] really well in a pinch.
- 1 :card[Tormod's Crypt]: The second part of my anti-graveyard package. This
  one is nice as it can just sit in play whilst you get prepped or be added to a
  pile to help defend against various tools like :card[Cephalid Coliseum] or
  even Endurance whilst you go for the win. It's less precise than Surgical but
  is a lot more effective.
- 1 :card[Volcanic Island]: Finally it's a land that makes {R}. It helps cast
  our blast effects. Not much else to say though you could consider to bring it
  in as an additional _bad Island_ in matchups where maybe you don't want Cavern.

## The Actual Sideboard Guide Bit

Here I will list decks in the order that I think of them. I will be trying to
add cards I have on my radar that I wish to respect, cards on my radar I might
respect less and variations to what I might board based on how I am feeling
(because I am very inconsistent sometimes). Please note this is a snapshot and
should not be considered gospel. The presence of _spice_ in an opponent's deck
can result in variations being made if they are needed and you should always try
to critically identify whether something seems sensible to you. If you don't
like an idea written here you don't have to follow it :)

### UR Delver, Grixis Delver, RUG Delver

- **Respect**: None of it. Maybe Monkey...
- **Disrespect**: The rest
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith
- **Bring in**: 2 Flusterstorm, 1 Thassa's Oracle

Try your best. Play around Daze, Monkey, Bolt, Wasteland, and Stifle when you
can. Don't play around them when you can't. If they have Torpor Orb, good for
them. They obviously wanted it more. The changes we make are because of
:card[Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer] because us having our own discard hit us is
devastating. Second Oracle lets you act a bit ore aggressively in pile building
and also acts as a buffer to random instances of having your sole win condition
exiled to monkey.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}

### Death and Taxes

- **Respect**: Deafening Silence, Spirit of the Labyrinth, Rishadan Port
- **Disrespect**: Thalia, Archive Trap, Solitude, Mindbreak Trap, Ethersworn
  Canonist
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith, 1 Cavern of Souls, 1
  Pact of Negation
- **Bring in**: 1 Chain of Vapor, 1 Massacre, 2-4 Force of Negation, maybe 1
  Thassa's Oracle

Death and Taxes is an interesting deck because in theory they have all the right
tools to win, but often they need multiple of them in one go to actually make it
happen. Often :card[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben] is too slow to do anything and
can be ignored, especially post Doomsday. The scary cards are the ones that tax
your mana or life total. :card[Wasteland] and :card[Rishadan Port] can be
devastating if having to go slow so aggressive mulliganing is advised.
:card[Kaldra Compleat] is also a house simply because it is the fastest threat
that they have. I have listed :card[Spirit of the Labyrinth] as the main card to
respect because post Doomsday it not only slows you down in progressing your
pile but also has a feisty attack of 3 which can quickly knock you down.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Ethersworn Canonist

### Stompy Decks

- **Respect**: Blood Moon, Trinisphere, Opposition Agent
- **Disrespect**: Chalice (to an extent)
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith, 2 Preordain, 1 Pact
  of Negation
- **Bring in**: 4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Chain of Vapor

These matchups can be the easiest wins or the hardest losses and sometimes it is
a toss of the dice based on respective mulligans which can decide it. Cavern
stays in because Chalice on 2 ruins your day otherwise. Try to avoid keeping
hands that die to Chalice on 1 unless that hand can just win on the next turn.
It's a swingy matchup but very winnable.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Chalice of the Void
Blood Moon
Trinisphere
:::

### Oops all Spells, BR Reanimator, Madness

- **Respect**: The fact they are faster than you. Burning Inquiry
- **Disrespect**: Most of their deck
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Edge of Autumn, 2 Preordain, 1 Pact
  of Negation, 1 Island, 1 Cavern of Souls
- **Bring in**: 4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Surgical Extraction, 1
  Tormod's Crypt, maybe 1-2 Flusterstorm

Another swingy set of matchups. Their best hands will beat your best hands. Vs.
Reanimator try to fight their graveyard enablers like :card[Entomb] or
:card[Faithless Looting]. Vs. Oops fight them however you can. These matchups I
personally find favourable but again, they can be very swingy.

I'll be honest, I don't think I have ever faced the Madness deck in the wild. As
a result this is a purely theory-crafted setup from having checked MTGGoldfish
for the most popular Legacy decks at the time of writing this and just thinking
"this'll be similar to the other fast graveyard strategies".

:::row{variant=CENTERED}

### Elves

- **Respect**: Allosaurus Shepherd and Endurance
- **Disrespect**: Choke
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith, 1 Cavern of Souls
- **Bring in**: 2 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Chain of Vapor, maybe
  1-2 Flusterstorm

Thanks to the 2 card combo of :card[Endurance] + :card[Allosaurus Shepherd] or
Shepherd + :card[Natural Order] this can be a tough fight in my opinion. I like
to try and go fast whilst being able to fight the green interaction. Some people
like to bring in :card[Massacre] but that is not an axis I really want to fight
them on.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
Allosaurus Shepherd
Nettle Sentinel
Natural Order

### Lands

- **Respect**: Endurance, Red Elemental Blast, Sphere of Resistance
- **Disrespect**: Choke, Wasteland, Ghost Quarter
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith, 2 Preordain or 1-2
  Daze
- **Bring in**: 4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Chain of Vapor

Lands very much has done a lot of work to try and shore up their combo matchups.
Nowadays you can expect to see both permanent and stack-based interaction to
join their usual share of mana denial elements. The trick here is to just make
sure you can keep up {U}{U} post Doomsday and to retain :card[CoS] in case of
REB or the occasional rogue Chalice. Don't ever try and fight them with grave
hate vs. the Loam plan, it's not worth it.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}

### TES, ANT

- **Respect**: Silence and Orim's Chant
- **Disrespect**: The rest
- **Take out**: 1 Cavern of Souls, 2 Preordain, 1 Island, 1 Street Wraith
- **Bring in**: 2-4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 2 Flusterstorm

Because of the sheer mass of interaction we can bring to the table and the
advantage in a topdeck war, we need to be careful about overloading too much on
permission. Storm variants are one of the matches I am considering not bringing
in the full 8 Force effects in for because we can easily dilute our own plan too
much in it. I don't bother bringing in REB effects because it's not the cantrips
we want to fight over.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}

### 8-Cast, Urza Echo

- **Respect**: Force of Will, Echo of Eons, Torpor Orb
- **Disrespect**: Chalice, Emry
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 2 Street Wraith, 2 Preordain, 1 Island
- **Bring in**: 2-4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Chain of Vapor,
  maybe 2 Flusterstorm, maybe 1 Volcanic Island, maybe 2 Pyroblast, maybe 1 Red
  Elemental Blast

These two decks I know are very different to face but I feel like I wanted to
put them together. Urza Echo feels very much like a stompy deck that can run
Forces and can be very tough, especially with :card[Hullbreacher] effects so
involved. 8-Cast feels easier with less explosiveness traded in for more
consistency. Either way, don't be afraid to let Chalices resolve and just try to
power out a quick win. My plan for these decks keeps changing as I try different
things but I was reasonably happy with the plan enacted which can be seen in
(shameless plug) [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtMGU39YAtw) and
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H62gxBL0lUA).

### Blue Soup: Stryfo Pile, BUG Zenith, Bant, Miracles, 4c Control

- **Respect**: Endurance, Meddling Mage, Dress Down, Flusterstorm
- **Disrespect**: Any deck with Yorion as a companion
- **Take out**: 2 Street Wraith, 1 Watery Grave, 1-2 Daze, maybe 1-2 Force of
  Will, maybe 1-2 Preordain, maybe 1-2 Personal Tutor
- **Bring in**: 1 Thassa's Oracle, maybe 1 Chain of Vapor, 2 Flusterstorm, 1
  Volcanic Island, maybe 2 Pyroblast, maybe 1 Red Elemental Blast

The main difficulty in facing _Blue Soup_ decks is that they could have anything
in them. It's a pain in the arse because it's all beatable but if you fail to
identify splashes or board for the wrong things you can get blown out because a
lot of them bring in so many different cards. Generally 1 for 1 interaction is
good and you want to be able to still have the ability to go under them but not
be too disadvantaged if the game drags on. I try to always keep at least 2
cycling effects even in these matchups.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}

### Jeskai Soup: Saga, Ragavan, Delver, Stoneblade

- **Respect**: Meddling Mage, Dress Down, Lightning Bolt, Ragavan, Day's Undoing
- **Disrespect**: Red Elemental Blast
- **Take out**: 2 Street Wraith, 1 Watery Grave, 1-2 Daze, maybe 1-2 Force of
  Will, maybe 1-2 Preordain, maybe 1-2 Personal Tutor
- **Bring in**: 1 Thassa's Oracle, maybe 1 Chain of Vapor, 2 Flusterstorm, 1
  Volcanic Island, maybe 2 Pyroblast, maybe 1 Red Elemental Blast

Or

- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith
- **Bring in**: 2 Flusterstorm, 1 Thassa's Oracle

Like _Blue Soup_ but harder thanks to :card[Ragavan, Nimbler Pilferer] and
:card[Expressive Iteration]. Often these might as well all be Delver decks just
with :card[Meddling Mage] to annoy us. You can very well justify bringing in
:card[Massacre] or :card[CoV] in these matchups. Again deck variance in the
opposing field can cause difficulty in selecting what to bring to the table.

### Cloudpost

- **Respect**: Endurance

- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 1 Street Wraith, 2 Preordain, 1 Pact
  of Negation
- **Bring in**: 4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Chain of Vapor

Cloudpost seems to be the best matchup for the deck. Remember no matchup is
unloseable, but sometimes it feels that way here. Just don't get blown out by
:card[Endurance] or :card[Torpor Orb] and you'll be fine.

### Painter

- **Respect**: Grindstone, Torpor Orb, Blood Moon, Trinisphere
- **Disrespect**: Nah, gotta respect Painter
- **Take out**: 1 Duress, 1 Thoughtseize, 2 Street Wraith, 1 Preordain, 1 Daze
- **Bring in**: 4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 1 Chain of Vapor

This can be a real tough matchup. A smart Painter player can really do well and
playing around an on-board :card[Grindstone] can be a real headache.

### OmniShow

- **Respect**: People who still run Release the Ants. Cunning Wish for Trickbind
- **Disrespect**: People who run :card[Shared Summoning]
- **Take out**: 2 Street Wraith, 1-2 Preordain, 1 Island, 1 Pact of Negation,
  maybe 1 Watery Grave, maybe 1 Lion's Eye Diamond, maybe 1 Deep Analysis
- **Bring in**: 2-4 Force of Negation, maybe 1 Thassa's Oracle, 2 Flusterstorm,
  maybe 1 Volcanic Island, maybe 2 Pyroblast, maybe 1 Red Elemental Blast

I love OmniShow and field it as my secondary deck of choice. Unfortunately it is
definitely clunkier than Doomsday and we have a huge advantage in being able to
make resilient pass-the-turn piles that win via their own :card[Show and Tell].

:::row{variant=CENTERED}

### Sneak and Show

- **Respect**: Daze

  maybe 1 Watery Grave, maybe 1 Lion's Eye Diamond, maybe 1 Deep Analysis, maybe
  2 Daze
- **Bring in**: 4 Force of Negation, 1 Thassa's Oracle, 2 Flusterstorm, maybe 1
  Volcanic Island, maybe 2 Pyroblast, maybe 1 Red Elemental Blast

Sneak and Show feels like a swingier OmniShow in terms of matchup. It's one of
the matchups I have experimented with :card[Daze] being brought in and out
depending on play vs. draw. Should still be favourable.

### That's It

I'm not going to list each and every archetype in the format and apologies if I
have missed yours. There are lots of cool decks and many are really fun to face.
I'm also not going to map the mirror because that is another matchup I change my
mind on all the time and we're not here to fight other Doomsdayers, right?
RIGHT?!

## Closing Thoughts

There you have it. An attempt at presenting a sideboard guide and the thoughts
that go behind it. As you can see it's not super well defined and, as I said
before, I deviate from it quite often but hey! It's a good starting point. One
thing I will note is that I find having 3 blast effects a little too many
perhaps so I might look to cut one for something but for what? That remains to
be seen.

I would strongly advise you to 1. Not try to mimic my decklist because it is
very much made for me and 2. Have a go at building your own little sideboard
guide as it's a very good exercise to go through. Even if you do disregard it
afterwards.

Until next time.

May you not get bored with all this siding.
