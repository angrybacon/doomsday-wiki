## Table of Contents

## Preface

The wiki author team has generally been against the writing of specific sideboard
guides as are often seen across the magic community. Sideboard guides can be
very helpful in allowing players to quickly pick up decks they may have seen from
other pilots that they enjoy or provide a quick starter if they do not have time
to work out the nuances of a deck themselves however The author team believe in a more
"teach a man to fish" approach whereby we encourage people to build their deck and
sideboard from the ground up and work out what works best for each pilot. There
is also a huge amount of potential variation that can be applied to the archetype
these days with lists often changing speed, style, colours and all manner of things
based on pilot experience, preference and metagame.

It's because of this that we present our [sideboard chapter](/chapters/meandeck/sideboard)
as a series of guiding principles instead of a rigid +x/-y format because we cannot
account for every decklist and what might be very common one day could very well become
obsolete the next. Even so, there are definitely advantages to having at least one
example guide if nothing else to try to promote people to write/discover their own
plans. I personally think everyone should have a go at mapping their plans for each
matchup at least once, even if you don't follow it perfectly or change your mind
completely at least you have gone through and worked out each slot and whether it is
justified or not to hold its place and it means you become more aware of the roles
each card has so that you can become flexible vs the unknown.

Because of the demand for it as a one-off article I thought I would provide my own
sideboard guide. This is not a guide I have properly written up before but it
will be a good exercise for me as well to write it. This guide will also try to
explain the reasoning behind some of the decisions and thus discuss both the main
deck configuration and my own style of play alongside it. It very well may not be
super applicable for you because of how you prefer to play (or because no one else
plays my deck) but hopefully it will encourage you to have a go working out your
own plans!

## Biases

The first things I should write about before even presenting the decklist is about my
own playstyle and personal bias towards the deck. These are the core principles behind
why I build it like I do and are based on my own play experience and ideals. It might
be worth before having a go at this yourself to work out some key points
that you feel about your deck so as to understand what you want from it.

#### 1. I like playing combo-control

This one is self explanatory. One of the best things about the current iterations of Doomsday
is I get to run both all my combo staples card:[DR], card:[LED], card:[DD] alongside
things like card:[FoW] with a full cantrip suite to boot! This means I can have
the choice to play the aggressive role (without all that nasty combat maths that
hurts my tiny brain) or pivot to take it slow a bit more until I want to win.
This flexibility is something I value highly.

#### 2. I see Doomsday as a mono {U} deck that happens to require {B}{B}{B}

This one is a funny one and one I have been citing since Oracle was printed.
People often look at me funny when I say this however it is definitely true. The
deck pre-Doomsday relies on being able to cantrip, cast counter magic and do
the things that blue decks like to do. Post-Doomsday all you need are some
draw effects and the ability to make {U}{U}. It's just that awkward bit in the
middle where you need to find {B}{B}{B} to actually cast Doomsday itself (and
on occasion firing off a discard spell). This is why in regards to manabase
I prize {U} over {B} and run a basic Island. It's also why every fetchable
land in my deck has the Island subtype and my fetch configuration is Island
centric.

#### 3. I hate relying on the top of my deck

The games that I lose which annoy me the most are the ones where it has gone
a bit long and I am waiting for "that one card" to win. The worst is when
"that one card" is literally any card with the text "draw a card" on. Often
it's vs UGx control piles and I have Doomsday, mana, protection in abundance
but the gamestate is such where I cannot do a PTT pile so all I need is any
method to dig into the pile post resolution. These are the losses that stick
in my mind even more so than the turn 1 blowouts with card:[Blood Moon] against
Moon Stompy or the "needed to dodge card:[Dz] one time" vs Delver. As a result
I run as many cantrips as I can reasonably fit into the deck whilst still
trying to retain the elements of the "Turbo" style. This is why you will
see some number of card:[Pre] in the deck alongside card:[Con] and the normal
cantrip/cycler suite.

#### 4. I tend to be fast to cast Doomsday, but slow after it resolves

This was something I hadn't thought of before until the lovely Francobolli
pointed it out in response to one of my 
[Youtube video uploads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlZ9mnCRFgQ):

> "@Doishy your play style is very much on the aggressive side to 
> cast doomsday and then maybe conservative making the piles. It is good 
> to see both those perspectives.

In this I am trying to slam Doomsday as fast as possible but will often build
a pile that passes 1-3 more turns (sometimes the full five) after it resolves.
This is why I like having Daze, why I run 3 card:[PT] and why I am almost
the complete "Turbo" shell but don't go full ham on cycling effects, 
multiple Considers and why I run card:[CoS] in the main.

#### 5. I am here to disrespect Delver

I have tried in the past to dedicate a lot of sideboard slots for beating
URx Delver decks before and I realised that the games I was winning against
them was because of tight play, a little bit of luck and mostly my main deck
tools. As a result I decided to run no dedicated Delver sideboard slots and
instead just work out a solid plan from the other tools I was using anyways. 
This is the one matchup I pretty much never deviate from my plan on and 
I am happy to take my 30-40% win rate against them where I can. 

#### 6. I like having access to a toolbox

You will notice through the guide I often do not take out card:[Con], card:[DA],
card:[IU], card:[LED] and I almost always leave in 2 cycler effects. This is 
because I like having the options to acces the instant win Deep Analysis pile,
fast card:[BS] piles and resilient Ideas Unbound piles. Even if they seem poor
in a matchup, simply having them available to you I think is important because
they grant you the most flexibility post Doomsday to tailor your pile to your
needs. In all liklihood I should probably cut some number of them more often but
I don't..... :D

#### 7. I am slow to make changes to my deck

I mostly play in paper (and then online when the MTGO all access passes come out).
I will always run a 75 for a few events to get a feel for what I like/do not like
and even then almost only ever change 1-2 cards max and normally from the sideboard.
Like at the time of writing this I am thinking of changing one sideboard card and that
is after about 2 months of playing with the current 75. I think it's important to
truly get a feel for what you are running and to try not to make knee-jerk decisions
based on one set of bad beats or a single event.
