title: Legacy for Goodies at Axion's Mega Weekend - Winner's Report and Metagame discussion
---

## Table of Contents

## Preface

On the weekend just gone (5th and 6th of February 2022) [Axion](https://www.axionnow.com/) hosted
their first CompREL Mega Weekend since the whole COVID thing started. This included
a massive Modern event, a unified Modern trios event and of course, one of their infamous
"Legacy for Goodies" events too. As Francois (the lovely owner) said during the player's
meeting, they were worried they would just about fill the seats for the 32 player capped
Legacy event however what actually happened was it sold out within a day almost!
The people have spoken, they want Legacy and it sounds like more events from Axion will
be appearing within the year!

It was an amazing event run with lots of lovely people involved with judging (big thanks to Nik,
our head judge), scorekeeping (big shout out to Will who also provided us with delicious
decklists and metagame data) and of course playing! It was great to see people just having fun, 
jamming some cards and enjoying themselves. There were only two drops from players in round 4
but other than that, everyone played the entire swiss which goes to show just how much people
just wanted to play!

The event was 32 players. 5 round swiss with a cut to top 4.
There were also two "bonus top 4s" for 5th to 8th place and 9th to 12th place respectively. 
The entire top 4 prized and the winners of the bonus top 4s also won some goodies. 
First place was a Revised Underground Sea, second a Revised Taiga and various other delicious
staples for 3rd/4th and the bonus top 4 winners.

## The Metagame

*Again a massive thanks to scorekeeper Will for getting us this data.*

Going into the event there were two decks I expected to see represented heavily but beyond
that I had no idea on what the meta could be. I expected a heavy UR Delver presence and a 
heavy Death & Taxes showing and looks like I was right about those.

Without further ado, here is the complete meta breakdown:

Yorion Death & Taxes	4  
UR Delver	            3  
Lands	                3  
4C Control (UWGb)    	2  
Cloudpost	            2  
Doomsday	            1  
UW Delverblade	      1  
Imperial Painter	    1  
4C Yorion Aluren	    1  
Bant Stoneblade     	1  
8-Cast	              1  
Moon Stompy	          1  
Jeskai Breacher	      1  
Goblins	              1  
UB Shadow	            1  
BUG Control	          1  
Aggro Affinity	      1  
Storm	                1  
Burn	                1  
Stiflenaught	        1  
Eldrazi Aggro	        1  
Esper Miracles	      1  
Reanimator	          1  

Death & Taxes was the highest represented archetype followed by UR Delver and then Lands. 
The meta diversity was huge which was great to see with 23 uniquue archetypes on display.
Obviously in a small paper event it's hard to draw any major conclusions other than people
played what they could/what they enjoy but it was nice to see so many different decks on display.

What we can see is that Graveyard based decks were very underrepresented with only one pilot
taking a stand. It's often tough to work out whether people are in the peaks of overloading
with anti-Graveyard hate or troughs of skimping out on it but with :card[Endurance] in abundance
alongside a large number of potential Force effects and :card[Bojuka Bogs] it likely is tricky
to find the wins without going full throttle with something like Oops All Spells.
Tempo, Prison and Blue Control were all equally represented in the top macro archetype slots
with 6 pilots each followed by Midrange at 5 pilots, Aggro at 4 and both Spell and Creature
combo decks at 2 each. 

As metagames go, this one does look like it could actually be quite hostile to Delver/Tempo
style lists given how much Yorion Death & Taxes, Cloudpost and Lands there was (all heralded to
be able to prey on traditional Delver decks) however despite this there were still two pilots
who made it into the top 4. It also looks like it would be a good meta for decks that prey
on some of the fairer strategies. Something like Elves would have likely been a decent choice
for the event. 

Righty, now for the Doomsday bit :3 

## Winner's Event Report :)

### Decklist

I was one of the lucky few who managed to secure a ticket and with only the knowledge that 
"there will probably be UR Delver and Death & Taxes" about I had to try and come up with my
list. To make things slightly trickier I had gone 1-3 at the last local FNM I had played in
(making me feel a little bummed out) and, probably more importantly, the :card[Ragavan, Nimbler Pilferer]
ban had come into effect so I was probably due to make some changes to my [previous list](/articles/2022/01/22/zero-respect#the-decklist)
whilst being unable to test for the event at all thanks to general life things getting in the way.

As a result I took my previous list as a starter and begun conversing online with various community
members to try and assess what changes I might want to make (shout out to Otterlady, Nevilshute and
Prepare4Robots especially on this). I knew I wanted to add additional discard effects into the
list somewhere and was most worried about Blue based "Soup" decks (Bant, 4C, Jeskai Breacher) just
because they can run such a diverse spread of relevant hate that, in normal lists, requires answers
that are otherwise really bad in those matchups. I spent a lot of time agonising over trying an
alternative way to bypass a :card[Torpor Orb] from say a RUG Saga deck such as good old :card[Tendrils of Agony]
or ways to remove a variety of other nuisance elements like :card[Meddling Mage] as well with tools
like :card[Kolaghan's Command] however it was decided to just keep to the theme of what I know and
just not respect that sort of behaviour. If blue decks want to bring such rude toys to play then
they are welcome to it!

The final major talking point which I was convinced to try was removing :card[DA] from the list.
A lot of people have started to run the deck still with :card[Con] but without Analysis as the
former still has [relevant pile application](/chapters/meandeck/brainstorm.md#brainstorm-pile---brainstorm-and-free-cantrip-available)
and acts as a decent cantrip to clear 2 cards in the face of a :card[Narset, Parter of Veils] 
whilst the latter only enables specific fast/efficient piles but ones that are very susceptible 
to a lot of hate in the format. Thanks to recent trends and discussion with folks I decided to 
risk it by removing the card from the deck entirely (it was discussed putting it in the board but
it shines most of all in game 1 scenarios).

When Consider was first spoilt I had in fact said the following:

> I'm going to buy Consider. Buy DA. Then probably only end up on one consider no  DA >.<
> - Doishy 08/06/2021

Looks like it took me a fair while to stick to what I had said initially but I guess past me
knew what they were talking about and the change seemed to work out well.

As a result then we made the following changes to the deck thus going into "Turbo Zero Respect version 0.6".

Maindeck:
-  -1 Deep Analysis
-  +1 Thoughtseize

Sideboard:
-  -1 Flusterstorm
-  +1 Duress

That's it. 

That's all I did. ([I had mentioned I am slow to change](/articles/2022/01/22/zero-respect.md#i-am-slow-to-make-changes-to-my-deck)). 

The :card[Flusterstorm] change was because I wanted to fit more discard in which could snipe
something like Torpor Orb and dealt with opposing Fluster's too whilst also being more
mana efficient in the long run vs things like Delver. It also is very strong against opposing
spelt based combo allowing you to keep a diverse suite of interaction. I had scoured
MTGGoldfish for what sort of interaction the "Soup" decks were packing and it looked like
:card[VoS] was at an all time low so I figured this is the time when discard is going to
look its best before people remember about that card again now that Monkey is gone!
The other potential cut was the 4th :card[FoN] but I decided on the fluster as, if nothing else,
I would have a hard time trying not to bring in too much interaction vs certain decks like
Bant where Fluster, REBs, Discard and some of the removal are all potential choices.

So here is the complete decklist:

### Main Report

So I'm just going to say this now for the record, I was feeling awful the day of the event.
We had driven up the day before and stayed with some friends (and had a lovely time) however
the friends in question were in the process of moving and so only had an air mattress to offer
for sleeping arrangements. This is normally not an issue however for whatever reason I just
could not sleep at all that night. As a result come Sunday morning when it was time to
get up to head to the event centre, I felt like literal death. I wolfed down a "not quite-hot-crossed-bun"
and headed to the bus stop to get to hotel looking and feeling hungover as all hell (despite not
having imbibed anything boozy the night before). 

Anyways I was there to play and was determined to have fun so having met up with some of the rest of the Bristol
crew, who were playing in the Unified Modern Trios event, and saying hello to our local judges, I headed
to the player meeting. Francois gave a lovely speech and hinted at some "giga" events in the future
which will be including Legacy in some form. Nik gave his official speech bit and we kicked off into
round 1.


#### Round 1 vs Connor on Yorion Death & Taxes

We shuffle up and I lose the coin toss. Connor reveals a Yorion which immediately let's me work out
he is likely on Death & Taxes or some sort of Blue Soup deck. I keep a 7 which has the potential for
a turn 1 Doomsday. Connor goes :card[Plains] into :card[Aether Vial] and that pretty much
lets me know the coast is clear. Annoyingly I could have had a turn 1 kill had I kept Deep Analysis
in but instead I just do a clean pass-the-turn pile using Consider for a fast game 1. 

Boarding is pretty simple for DnT, Massacre and Chain come in along with FoNs for :card[Deafening Silence].
Discard, :card[CoS] and some :card[SW]/:card[Pre] come out.

Game 2 showed the first of many misplays in the day that I blame the fatigue for. I keep 5 cards, another turn 1
Doomsday with Force protection but no land (:card[DR] off of :card[LP]). Opponent once again tries to run
out a Vial and I Force it pitching Force. This was a massive mistake. I should've worked out the timings
of how many turns I would need to pass and what could beat me in passing that many turns. I would need
to pass 3 turns post Doomsday (unless I get lucky on my draw step with a land or another Petal,:card[BS],
Street Wraith or :card[LED]) and so I should've worked out what beats the likely pile of {fetch, fetch, TO,
:card[Island], :card[Underground Sea]} or even what beats me trying to go for a faster 2 turn pass pile
that maybe uses Brainstorm or something else similar. Basically there is not enough pressure that
can come down from 2 lands and Vial for passing 3 turns assuming you hold Force for the first thing
they cast. The Forcing of Vial was a poor decision and I should've just held it back for a turn 2 play.

:::row{variant=pile}
- Flooded Strand
- Misty Rainforest
- TO
- Island
- Underground Sea
:::

So I draw a dud for turn and jam Doomsday building exactly what was described above and pass the turn.
I was justifiably punished by Connor jamming a turn 2 :card[Stoneforge Mystic] which promptly finds
:card[Kaldra Compleat] and simple as that I was dead. I play land and say go, he puts Kaldra in and hits
for 5. Land go. Hit for 5 and dead.

We learn from out mistakes and move on. Game 3 I keep 7, Connor 5 and I once again jam a turn 1 Doomsday. 
With a full grip and on the play there are very few scenarios where a Death & Taxes player can win
from here and we get our first (somewhat sloppy) win of the day.

```
Match:   2-1
Matches: 1-0
Games:   2-1
```


#### Round 2 vs Jons on Lands ft. Enlightened Tutor

I manage to win the dice roll here and we both keep 7. I have the potential for a Doomsday
on turn 2 thanks to Petal so I just play fetch and pass. Jons draws and drops
an :card[Urza's Saga] followed by a :card[Mox Diamond] pitching a :card[Wasteland] and says go. This
is almost certainly lands in my head so I jam Doomsday turn 2 and build a pass-the-turn pile that can survive
some mix of Wasteland and Endurance. I pass and at the end of turn the spice appears. Jons casts :card[Enlightened Tutor]
which grabs a :card[Sphere of Resistance]. This is something I can ignore and I just play lands and pass finally
jamming a :card[PoN] protected :card[TO] with no issue.

Boarding is similar to Death & Taxes. Chain and FoNs come in. Discard and Wraiths/Preordains come out.
Cavern stays in because Lands often plays REB effects and it's basically free to keep in.

We both keep 6 and I have a turn 2 Doomsday. I build a pile to beat Endurance, REB and Torpor Orb figuring it
would be present in the side of a deck that runs E-Tutor. What I fail to do is build a pile that beats
:card[Ghost Quarter] and double Wasteland thanks to :card[Elvish Reclaimer] and I get cut off the {U}{U} 
for Oracle. Oof.

Game 3 we both keep 7. I can't remember too much but I think play fetches for turns 1 and 2. A :card[Null Rod]
is jammed by Jons turn 2 so I Brainstorm in response. The reasoning here was I only had 2 mana sources and
a Doomsday in hand. If I find a land or Ritual I can just let Rod resolve. If I find a Petal then I Force it
and just try to rush things faster. I find no land but I do find Petal so I force it and jam a turn 3 Doomsday.
This time I successfully build around the hate faced and land a Cavern fueled Oracle with no issue.

```
Match:   2-1
Matches: 2-0
Games:   4-2
```

Up to this point I had been running on fumes and a little pick-me-up in the form of half a can of 
energy drink from my friend Ben was very much needed. I assumed I had been winning mostly
on decent starting hands and decent matchups but eventually this nice ride was bound to end.


#### Round 3 vs David on UR Delver

I win the die roll again and keep a decent seven that allows a turn 1 Doomsday with Thoughtseize backup.
I drop Sea and Thoughtseize seeing :card[Brazen Borrower], :card[Dragon's Rage Channeler], :card[FoW], 
:card[Unholy Heat], :card[Lightning Bolt] and 2 lands. "Oh boy, it's Delver time". So we take Force, jam
our turn 1 Doomsday, build a classic *anti-Delver* pile of :card[EoA], Fetch, TO, Cavern, Island. This, or some
variation of it works really well against all but the super fast aggro hands Delver can get with 3 power
creatures and multiple Bolts. David fails to find what he needs and my pile completes.

:::row{variant=pile}
- Scalding Tarn
- EoA
- TO
- CoS
- Island
:::

Boarding for Delver is now Ragavan free (woo!) but I decided to still bring in the second Oracle
to enable yolo slamming or multiple slam piles to just try and get those fast wins in. 2 Wraiths
and a Thoughtseize come out. Duress, Fluster and Oracle come in. I might try not bringing in
Fluster and keeping 4 discard in the future also maybe leaving the second Oracle in. We'll
play around a bit.

Game 2 is the most "non-gamey" of the day with me having to mull to 5 with a Doomsday. My next 
two draws are Doomsdays and between poor draws, Delver pressure and Wasteland I don't really get to
do anything of note.

Game 3 I keep an alright 6 and go for a Thoughtseize. This proves crucial as I see a hand of Delver, 
Surgical, Island, Tarn, 2 :card[Murktide Regent] and Ponder. This hand is really anemic and I 
take Delver buying me a lot of life in the medium term. I find what I need and jam turn 3 doing a similar
trick to game 1 and with no pressure from David I can just land-go to victory.

Phew. Okay, well we managed to beat the tricky deck somehow.
I tried to have a semi nap at a table on my bag. Alas did not help Q.Q

```
Match:   2-1
Matches: 3-0
Games:   6-1
```


  
#### Round 4 vs James on Yorion Death & Taxes

The James mirror. I was not prepared for such things!
