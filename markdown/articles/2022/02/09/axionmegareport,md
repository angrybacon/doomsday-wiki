title: Legacy for Goodies at Axion's Mega Weekend - Winner's Report and Metagame discussion
---

## Table of Contents

## Preface

On the weekend just gone (5th and 6th of February 2022) [Axion](https://www.axionnow.com/) hosted
their first CompREL Mega Weekend since the whole COVID thing started. This included
a massive Modern event, a unified Modern trios event and of course, one of their infamous
"Legacy for Goodies" events too. As Francois (the lovely owner) said during the player's
meeting, they were worried they would just about fill the seats for the 32 player capped
Legacy event however what actually happened was it sold out within a day almost!
The people have spoken, they want Legacy and it sounds like more events from Axion will
be appearing within the year!

It was an amazing event run with lots of lovely people involved with judging (big thanks to Nik,
our head judge), scorekeeping (big shout out to Will who also provided us with delicious
decklists and metagame data) and of course playing! It was great to see people just having fun, 
jamming some cards and enjoying themselves. There were only two drops from players in round 4
but other than that, everyone played the entire swiss which goes to show just how much people
just wanted to play!

The event was 32 players. 5 round swiss with a cut to top 4.
There were also two "bonus top 4s" for 5th to 8th place and 9th to 12th place respectively. 
The entire top 4 prized and the winners of the bonus top 4s also won some goodies. 
First place was a Revised Underground Sea, second a Revised Taiga and various other delicious
staples for 3rd/4th and the bonus top 4 winners.

## The Metagame

*Again a massive thanks to scorekeeper Will for getting us this data.*

Going into the event there were two decks I expected to see represented heavily but beyond
that I had no idea on what the meta could be. I expected a heavy UR Delver presence and a 
heavy Death & Taxes showing and looks like I was right about those.

Without further ado, here is the complete meta breakdown:

Yorion Death & Taxes	4  
UR Delver	            3  
Lands	                3  
4C Control (UWGb)    	2  
Cloudpost	            2  
Doomsday	            1  
UW Delverblade	      1  
Imperial Painter	    1  
4C Yorion Aluren	    1  
Bant Stoneblade     	1  
8-Cast	              1  
Moon Stompy	          1  
Jeskai Breacher	      1  
Goblins	              1  
UB Shadow	            1  
BUG Control	          1  
Aggro Affinity	      1  
Storm	                1  
Burn	                1  
Stiflenaught	        1  
Eldrazi Aggro	        1  
Esper Miracles	      1  
Reanimator	          1  

Death & Taxes was the highest represented archetype followed by UR Delver and then Lands. 
The meta diversity was huge which was great to see with 23 uniquue archetypes on display.
Obviously in a small paper event it's hard to draw any major conclusions other than people
played what they could/what they enjoy but it was nice to see so many different decks on display.

What we can see is that Graveyard based decks were very underrepresented with only one pilot
taking a stand. It's often tough to work out whether people are in the peaks of overloading
with anti-Graveyard hate or troughs of skimping out on it but with :card[Endurance] in abundance
alongside a large number of potential Force effects and :card[Bojuka Bogs] it likely is tricky
to find the wins without going full throttle with something like Oops All Spells.
Tempo, Prison and Blue Control were all equally represented in the top macro archetype slots
with 6 pilots each followed by Midrange at 5 pilots, Aggro at 4 and both Spell and Creature
combo decks at 2 each. 

As metagames go, this one does look like it could actually be quite hostile to Delver/Tempo
style lists given how much Yorion Death & Taxes, Cloudpost and Lands there was (all heralded to
be able to prey on traditional Delver decks) however despite this there were still two pilots
who made it into the top 4. It also looks like it would be a good meta for decks that prey
on some of the fairer strategies. Something like Elves would have likely been a decent choice
for the event. 

Righty, now for the Doomsday bit :3 

## Winner's Event Report :)

### Decklist

I was one of the lucky few who managed to secure a ticket and with only the knowledge that 
"there will probably be UR Delver and Death & Taxes" about I had to try and come up with my
list. To make things slightly trickier I had gone 1-3 at the last local FNM I had played in
(making me feel a little bummed out) and, probably more importantly, the :card[Ragavan, Nimbler Pilferer]
ban had come into effect so I was probably due to make some changes to my [previous list](/articles/2022/01/22/zero-respect#the-decklist)
whilst being unable to test for the event at all thanks to general life things getting in the way.

As a result I took my previous list as a starter and begun conversing online with various community
members to try and assess what changes I might want to make (shout out to Otterlady, Nevilshute and
Prepare4Robots especially on this). I knew I wanted to add additional discard effects into the
list somewhere and was most worried about Blue based "Soup" decks (Bant, 4C, Jeskai Breacher) just
because they can run such a diverse spread of relevant hate that, in normal lists, requires answers
that are otherwise really bad in those matchups. I spent a lot of time agonising over trying an
alternative way to bypass a :card[Torpor Orb] from say a RUG Saga deck such as good old :card[Tendrils of Agony]
or ways to remove a variety of other nuisance elements like :card[Meddling Mage] as well with tools
like :card[Kolaghan's Command] however it was decided to just keep to the theme of what I know and
just not respect that sort of behaviour. If blue decks want to bring such rude toys to play then
they are welcome to it!

The final major talking point which I was convinced to try was removing :card[DA] from the list.
A lot of people have started to run the deck still with :card[Con] but without Analysis as the
former still has [relevant pile application](/chapters/meandeck/brainstorm.md#brainstorm-pile---brainstorm-and-free-cantrip-available)
and acts as a decent cantrip to clear 2 cards in the face of a :card[Narset, Parter of Veils] 
whilst the latter only enables specific fast/efficient piles but ones that are very susceptible 
to a lot of hate in the format. Thanks to recent trends and discussion with folks I decided to 
risk it by removing the card from the deck entirely (it was discussed putting it in the board but
it shines most of all in game 1 scenarios).

When Consider was first spoilt I had in fact said the following:

> I'm going to buy Consider. Buy DA. Then probably only end up on one consider no  DA >.<
> - Doishy 08/06/2021

Looks like it took me a fair while to stick to what I had said initially but I guess past me
knew what they were talking about and the change seemed to work out well.

As a result then we made the following changes to the deck thus going into "Turbo Zero Respect version 0.6".

Maindeck:
-  -1 Deep Analysis
-  +1 Thoughtseize

Sideboard:
-  -1 Flusterstorm
-  +1 Duress

That's it. 

That's all I did. ([I had mentioned I am slow to change](/articles/2022/01/22/zero-respect.md#i-am-slow-to-make-changes-to-my-deck)). 

The :card[Flusterstorm] change was because I wanted to fit more discard in which could snipe
something like Torpor Orb and dealt with opposing Fluster's too whilst also being more
mana efficient in the long run vs things like Delver. It also is very strong against opposing
spelt based combo allowing you to keep a diverse suite of interaction. I had scoured
MTGGoldfish for what sort of interaction the "Soup" decks were packing and it looked like
:card[VoS] was at an all time low so I figured this is the time when discard is going to
look its best before people remember about that card again now that Monkey is gone!
The other potential cut was the 4th :card[FoN] but I decided on the fluster as, if nothing else,
I would have a hard time trying not to bring in too much interaction vs certain decks like
Bant where Fluster, REBs, Discard and some of the removal are all potential choices.

So here is the complete decklist:

### Main Report

So I'm just going to say this now for the record, I was feeling awful the day of the event.
We had driven up the day before and stayed with some friends (and had a lovely time) however
the friends in question were in the process of moving and so only had an air mattress to offer
for sleeping arrangements. This is normally not an issue however for whatever reason I just
could not sleep at all that night. As a result come Sunday morning when it was time to
get up to head to the event centre, I felt like literal death. I wolfed down a "not quite-hot-crossed-bun"
and headed to the bus stop to get to hotel looking and feeling hungover as all hell (despite
