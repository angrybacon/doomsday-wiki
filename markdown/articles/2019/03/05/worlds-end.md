title: The World's End - An Experimental Frenzy
---

Well it has been awhile. Apologies for the silence however unlike d8dk32, the
eternal and strongwilled champion of BBB Sorcery Spells everywhere I admit the
Probe ban broke me. I had always said that if they took Probe that would be done
on the deck and well, they did it.

Gits.

Since then I did some soul searching, I have played ANT and numerous variations
thereof, I have played UB Omnitell, Bant Bomberman, BUG Lands, Greedy Mentor
Tempo, UWr Standstill. All of it has been fun but nothing has yet "clicked" with
me the same way and my wallet is screaming in pain as I keep wanting to try new
things. I did try running an older style Rev 614 list (Doomsday x Show and Tell
featuring Emrakul and Shelldock Isle) going 3-3 in an event which had one of the
best games of magic I have ever played in.

## Bonus Mini Report!

I am against UB Shadow, Game 1. We both know what each other are on. He has a
threat-light hand with disruption and burns himself down to 13 stripping my
hand. I play a {{Cloud of Faeries}} and start bashing in, holding countermagic
up. He ignores them for a bit, even shuffling away a Fatal Push with a BS when
suddenly his life is low enough to be in danger. We of course have both been
joking the whole time that I was now playing the Delver deck and would get there
with it. He finally finds his own Delver to drop and lo' it does not flip (there
is a long running joke that his Delvers never flip). Through his digging he
looks for and finds 3 Delver of Secrets but lo' none of them flip and he dies to
a 1/1 Faerie Cloud... Wow.

For anyone mad enough to try the very untuned and fun list I dub it *Spaghetti
and Meatballs*.

Anyways I digress. Jumping to ahead a bit, when {{Experimental Frenzy}} was
spoiled everyone had a think about it but most people just went "hmm, probs not
great tbh". One person however saw the real potential. Reversemermaid on the
DDFT Discord (first as some drunken fun started throwing out fun attempts at
using the card and then suddenly...

Did this guy just say infinite storm with Frenzy out? Suddenly, people were
interested. Myself included!

Looking into the card and decklist more there were some key things identified.

1. Frenzy plus Doomsday is an instant win.
2. Frenzy plus Doomsday is infinite Storm instant win.
3. Frenzy plus Doomsday assuming you have B post DD is an instant win even with
   Surgical on LED
4. You can even sub out Tendrils for Collective Brutality and it would still
   work
5. Frenzy is a weird card

Deep diving into point five further. With Frenzy out suddenly deck construction
considerations and card sequencing become very different. LED becomes literal
Lotus. Lands become huge liabilities and Cantrips reverse themselves. Take
Preordain for instance. Normally if you see two bad cards you bottom both and
draw a fresh one. With frenzy out you should instead bottom one, draw one and
then have the fresh one on the top of your library. Things like Fetches and
{{Conjurer's Bauble}} can now help clear "dud" cards off the top of the library
and your hand becomes a weird part graveyard part Brainstorm access pool
resource. Ponder becomes interesing as you can clear a dead card by "drawing" it
and then keep two desirables but all this means thinking in a way very unlike
how you would normally.

Now the nice thing about this card is the default Frenzy pile is very easy.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!ToA}} {{!DD}}</row>

So Assume Frenzy is out and you cast Doomsday, stack the above.

1. Cast LED, from the top of your deck, crack for {B}{B}{B}
2. Cast LED, from the top of your deck, crack for {B}{B}{B}
3. Cast LED, from the top of your deck, crack for {B}{B}{B}
4. Cast Tendrils from the top of your deck for 5 storm and have {{BBBBB}} left in pool
5. Cast Doomsday stack \[LED, LED, LED, ToA, DD\]
6. Repeat as required

The nice thing is the repeat stacks can use the Doomsday in the yard to form the
new piles. The life gain from Tendrils helps mitigate the lifeloss from Doomsday
allowing you to go infinite. As per point 4 above, Collextive Brutalitiy can
also be used as eventually your Doomsday life total will go down to 1 or 2, you
cast CoBru back up to 3/4 and thus can repeat ad infinium.  
Hell, you could even consider running {{Aetherflux Reservoir}}!

As per the example above:

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!Aetherflux Reservoir}} {{!DD}}</row>

1. Cast LED, from the top of your deck, crack for {B}{B}{B}
2. Cast LED, from the top of your deck, crack for {B}{B}{B}
3. Cast LED, from the top of your deck, crack for {B}{B}{B}
4. Cast AR from the top of your deck for {{BBBBB}} left in pool
5. Cast Doomsday, gaining 6 life stack \[LED, LED, LED, DD, ?\]
6. Repeat as required

Eventually the life gain will ramp up so that you go about 50 life and you can
dome your opponent as required! This is of course just an amusing idea and in no
way should be considered competetive!

## Decklist

Meme cards aside, the actual deck construction currently under consideration
isn't too far removed from pre-ban lists. As Frenzy and Burning Wish do not pair
well Wish has been cut and obviously Probe is now gone too. Tendrils come back
into the main and some extra cantrip effects and discard are added.  
Some tricks remain from pre-ban era. Conjurer's Bauble remains at least a one-of
alongside Act on Impulse to enable an easy non-Frenzy pile.

<row variant="pile">{{!AoI}} {{!LED}} {{!ToA}} {{!Pn}} {{!CB}}</row>

Some other cards come in to help with combo and consistency. Lim DÃ»l's Vault is
a classic UB card that has been used as a Vampiric Tutor for awhile and is often
dismissed due to the card disadvantage it provides. However consider with Frenzy
out. Suddenly you get to either tutor what you need to play immediately or even
create a "Frenzy Stack" to chain off the top of your deck.

Lands wise, you want as low a count as possible to avoid hitting them with
Frenzy however you still need enough to cast your cards. 14-15 seem to be the
commonly preferred count and these are supplemented by 4 Petals, 4 LED, 4 DR and
3-4 CR.

Protection comes in the form of 4 TS, 2-4 Duress and 0-1 Collective Brutality.

Taking this into account lists are starting to look similar to the following:

<div deckfile="2019/03/ddeft.txt" />

This has a lot of flex still available and, even as I type this, people are
offering to fight me over running only three Frenzy and not four. I like three
as Frenzy is a dead card usually in a Frenzy chain however you do generally want
to find one often. Currently there is no definitive correct list but feel free
to use the above as a guideline for now.

## First Run

So I was persuaded and took the above list to a local FNM, 4 rounds.  
Somehow I went 3-1, not bad for a first run at all however I felt somewhat like
a fraud. The deck was really fun however every win I got I felt like I 100%
cheesed it. Maybe this is something akin to imposter syndrome but I had gone in
to the night expecting to get a 2-2 finish at best with stars aligning.

The breakdown of what I played against was as such:

vs ANT (2-0)  
vs UR Delver (1-2)  
vs Grixis Control (2-1)  
vs Burn (2-0)

Hopefully this shows I wasn't just playing against Tier 13 jank but instead a
decent mix of proven archetypes, all with experienced pilots. Despite this I
still feel odd about this strange new coffee filled brew.

Maybe it's because I am a tea drinker? `:think:`

Do I lack faith in the deck? Most certainly.  
Did I do well despite minimal practice and having a 75 full of really silly
cards? Well, yes... seems I did...

One run of 4 rounds however does not statistically significant data make
however, as people who have read the old wiki stuff will know, I like numbers!
As soon as this new brew was announced and tried we at the cabal of Doomsdayers
decided to get our rites on and ressurrect an old friend. The result
spreadsheet. At the time of writing we now have 164 matches recorded as a
community with the following statistical breakdown:

| Match Win % | Average Combo Turn | Average Mulligan |
| :---------: | :----------------: | :--------------: |
| 68.29%      | 3.51               | 6.75             |

Even for a skeptic like myself, this seems pretty good already. The data
obviously has all the issues that community derived data has and is collected
from a mixture of pilots of differing lists, both online and in paper. Take from
it what you will.

## Final Thoughts

> *What will be will be*  
> *Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough*  
> *And when the night gives way*  
> *It's like a brand new Doomsday*

*Lyrics from the song "Doomsday" by Architects from the Album "Holy Hell" (2017)

So welcome to a potential new world of degenerate combo. It might not be lean.
It might not be pretty. It might not even be good. But whilst the Experimental
Frenzy buzz is on a high, I will be enjoying trying to cast Doomsday once more
and maybe, just maybe, DDFT can evolve into DDEFT (Still pronounced the same).
