title: Doomsday at the Legacy Pit Open - An interview with RomarioVidal
---

## Preface

Last weekend (weekend of September the 18th 2021) The Legacy Pit hosted the
Legacy Pit Open, a large competetive event for Legacy in the US. The event 
was very successful and a number of people have already written reports / write
ups of their tournament experience. A number of archetypes were represented
including a number of people out to jam some Doomsday in paper. We approached
those who were part of the online community and asked if anyone was willing to
write up a report of their event and we had a brilliant response with 4 pilots
submitting reports for this article and 1 of them even offering to talk over
the experience in an interview too!

For the wider meta and to follow the decklists within the event it can all be
found online along with the organiser's website (they produce a lot of good
content so please check them out!):

## The Interview with Romario

Linked below you can find a link to the interview I (Doishy) had with Romario
Vidal. This was a great chat and covered his thoughts going into the event, 
his deck choice decisions, the event itself and future thoughts including
how {{Consider}} might be changing the lists pilots run. The interview is 
just under 2 hours (1 hour 49 minutes) and has been cleaned up to hopefully
make it palatable for the ears. Currently it is only available on Youtube because
unfortunately the payment model on SoundCloud means we cannot upload any additional
content on there without paying for the priviledge. Please do have a listen if
you have time!

## The Player's Reports

We had 4 players submit reports which you will be able to read below. Overall
Doomsday had a very good showing in the event, despite the high numbers of
{U}{R} Delver and Ragavan decks in general. With 11 pilots Doomsday, had around
a 3% meta share and boasted an impressive 58.54% match win rate (without mirror). 
This was the best performance of any deck with a playerbase >10 in the event so
a huge well done to all the player's collective performance. 

The players who were able to submit a report were RomarioVidal, VendillionMisclique,
germancouch and Ruta Barracuda so a huge thank-you to them for being willing
to take the time to provide those reports. There were also some other great results
from other players but they were not able to find the time to submit anything.

"This past weekend the guy from The Legacy Pit hosted an 
event in Frederick MD, this was the first large event since
the start of the pandemic in NA. The tournament was only a
few hours away driving from my house and, like a lot of other
legacy enthusiasts, I was itching to play some paper legacy.

The general perception was the meta was being dominated by 
Ragavan/DRC/Urza's Saga decks. Out of those 3, Ragavan represented 
the biggest threat to my deck of choice: Doomsday. I didn’t 
really do any extensive testing or preparation for the event
due to some family schedule changes and some other personal 
businesses, but I was did play a good number of leagues and 
tried a few different deck configurations. Eventually I settled
on the “Kai Sawatari” Doomsday list, it’s the list most 
similar to the lists I was familiar and have had some previous 
good results.

So onto the event, we were required to submit decklists and register
ahead of time since there wouldn’t be any in-person registration, 
with that being said I registered the Wednesday before the event."

#### Round 1 vs Sam Roukas on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Loss (0-2).

G1 I kept a hand that could cast Doomsday with {{Force of Will}} but there 
were no lands. If I remember correctly this was my opening 7: 2x {{Lotus Petal}},
{{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Force of Will}}, {{Daze}}.
I am also on the draw in this game. They played a {{Wasteland}} and passed the 
turn. On my turn I cast Petal > {{Thoughtseize}}, I see double {{Daze}},
{{Expressive Iteration}} and some lands, I took a {{Daze}}; I cast {{Dark Ritual}}
into {{Doomsday}}, now the pile I ended up building was what I like to call
the DnT pile, 2x fetches, {{Thassa's Oracle}} and 2 fetchable lands. This pile
would lose to a second piece of countermagic but it would beat removal,
the {{Daze}} I knew about and {{Wasteland}}. They drew a {{Force of Will}}
and we went to play g2.

G2 Nothing really interesting happened in this game I took a long time to find 
{{Doomsday}} while Ragavan kept attacking by the time I found {{Doomsday}} it 
was too late.

#### Round 2 vs Denver Rapp on {U}{B} Reanimator. Win (2-0).

This deck was a bit of a brew but it had all the good cards you would expect
to see in an reanimator deck plus some {{Show and Tell}} and some tin fins elements.

G1 I saw a basic Swamp and an {{Entomb}}, that was it. When I went for the combo
they seemed to just have f6’d. I sideboarded for {B}{R} reanimator.

G2 Opponent caught me off guard when they played a basic Island into {{Careful Study}},
I sideboarded out some of my discard spells but now I realized I am playing against 
a deck that is also playing countermagic. Luckily they were able to put {{Iona, Shield of Emeria}}
in the graveyard but not reanimate it back before I could resolve {{Thassa’s Oracle}}.

#### Round 3 vs Derek Toth on Urza Echo. Win (2-0).

G1. This is another game that I didn’t get the  right deck my opponent was playing.
They cast a {{Chalice of the Void]] on turn one off a {{City of Traitors}} which I
countered. I cast {{Doomsday}} the following turn and make a pile that can beat 
anything but a {{Trinisphere}}, they don’t cast anything and just pass the turn,
{{Thassa’s Oracle}} enters the battlefield and we reach for our sideboards. I thought
my opponent was on mono {R} stompy but in this case I think I would still SB the same way.

G2. They had sort of a slow start just casting some baubles but nothing else until after
I resolved {{Doomsday}}, they cast a {{Karn, the Great Creator}}, I let it resolve even though
I had {{Force of Negation}}, {{Force of Will}} and a blue card in hand. They minus Karn 
to get a {{Tormod’s Crypt}} then try to flashback an {{Echo of Eons}} with a {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}.
I countered and won on the following turn.

#### Round 4 vs Tony Murate (Into_Play) on Mono {G} Cloudpost. Win (2-0).

This round I played against the great and powerful Tony Murata aka into_play 
on mtgo, well known caster of {{Primeval Titan}}s.

G1. So this is one of the best MUs for {{Doomsday}}, it’s not say you can’t lose
as the combo player, with the printing of {{Endurance}} things got a lot more tricky.
I wasn't expecting much interaction from Tony’s side of the table before board and 
made a pretty basic {{Brainstorm}} pile.

G2. I boarded in the {{Emrakul, the Aeon's Torn}} + {{Shelldock Isle}} plan in this game.
I knew it could be a bad idea since they play cards like {{Pithing Needle}}, {{Karakas}}
and possibly {{Wasteland}}/{{Ghost Quarter}}. I cast {{Doomsday}} on turn 2, the pile
I made was {{Brainstorm}} (Emrakul was in my hand), {{Shelldock Isle}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}},
{{Underground Sea}} and {{Doomsday}}. I put shelldock in play on turn 3, Tony cast a
{{Crop Rotation}} when Emrakul resolves, I countered and he conceded. The idea here was 
to have a second {{Doomsday}} to refill my deck in case I needed to attack twice with Emrakul.

#### Round 5 vs Bob Huang (Griselpuff) on {U} Urza Affinity. Loss (1-2).

Played against legacy master Bob Huang, earlier in the day I asked if he was on Delver he told me 
Affinity. Honestly I thought was trolling me for a second, it turns out he was not.

G1 . I mulled to 6 trying to find a hand that could cast a quick Doomsday, but I wasn’t able to
put {B}{B}{B} and {{Doomsday}} together before a couple of constructs reduced my life total to 0.

G2 . I tried basically the same plan as game 1 but this time I was able to combo before getting 
attacked down to 0.

G3 . I found the combo pieces a turn too late, but overall I think this was one of the MUs I
hadn’t played any matches against it, I didn’t really approach the games correctly.

#### Round 6 vs Matthew Hackbirt (TheHackbert) on Cephalid Breakfast. Win (2-0).

Played against another great player from Arizona, the awesome Matt Hackbert.

G1 . Last time I talked to Matt he was playing Tin Fins/Ice Station Zebra type of decks
but he was also posting in the Doomsday discord. I was able to combo kinda early in the
game, and the only cards I saw were a couple cantrips and a {{Cabal Therapy}}.

G2 . I thought Matt was on some kind of combo and I was right I just wasn’t expecting
cephalid breakfast. Funny part is I kept a hand with 3 {{Doomsday}}, the only thing I 
kept thinking was “If he plays a Therapy I am conceding before he even names “Doomsday”.
Matt made a small mistake that ended up costing him the game and therefore the match.

#### Round 7 vs Jeffrey Carr on {U}{R} Sagavan. Win (2-1).

Things started getting interesting from this round on, at least in terms of tournament 
prize. Earlier in the day the tournament organizers announced they expanded the prize 
support to anyone who finished X-3 or better. At this point I had 2 losses, which meant
I could only lose 1 match in the last 3 rounds if I wanted to at least make my entry 
fee money back. You can imagine I was very thrilled to face probably the worst MU for Doomsday.

G1 . Now this is getting late in the day, I am starting to get a bit tired, not writing
notes means I am not 100% on these boardstate and play sequences but I am going to to my 
best. This game was decided by an early {{Doomsday}} and later a {{Thassa’s Oracle}} with
some {{Force of Will}} back up, but my opponent didn’t actually have any interactions
besides the {{Daze}} they had for my Doomsday.

G2 . I lost to a {{Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer}}, plus {{Wasteland}} and {{Murktide Regent}}.
I did cast a late {{Thoughtseize}} for some extra information and saw a {{Torpor Orb}}
in my opponent’s hand.

G3 . I was able to resolve {{Doomsday}} and make a pile that ended with me casting
{{Thassa’s Oracle}} off {{Cavern of Souls}}. Barring some {{Stifle}} shenanigans this
pile was perfect for this scenario, and now the dream to cash the event was still alive.

#### Round 8 vs Christian Fuller on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-0).

Well, as it turns out I was going to have to play against some hard MU in these last rounds.

G1 . This was kinda funny, both me and my opponent just mulliganed into oblivion.
My opener was 5 lands (mixed of {{Underground Sea}} and fetches) {{Ponder}} and {{Daze}},
after that I saw two hands without lands, both me and my opponent decided to pile shuffle.
I stopped at 4 and they went down to 3 cards, I kept a hand resilient to {{Wasteland}} and
it could cantrip. The hand I see after casting {{Duress}} is 3x {{Wasteland}}s. I ended
up winning this game but my opponent came really close to making up the card disadvantage
from the mulligan.

G2. I used the SB plan for Delver, and {{Pact of Negation}} really shined in the combo turn.
It felt super rewarding to win this and the previous round. This also meant I was guaranteed
to get my entry fee money back and now I was going to play for some extra $45.

#### Round 9 vs Michael Mapson on {G}{W} Depths. Win (2-0).

In this round I played someone who I considered to be one of the nicest people I have met 
playing this game Michael Mapson. Mike hosts a podcast about Modern and Legacy, he also
has been putting really good results with this Depths variant, by the way this is 
also another mu doomsday is favored. To be honest I was kinda relieved I wouldn’t have 
to play against Ragavan for the third time in a row.

G1 . Like I said previously this is a mu Doomsday is favored, much in the same way Doomsday
is favored against Mono {G} Post but now you do have to have a plan for {{Endurance}}.
I wasn’t very familiar with the stock 75 for this deck but I suspected they weren’t 
playing {{Endurance}} in the main deck. I cast doomsday, Mike asked me if he was dead
to which I replied “yes if you don’t have any interaction” they said “I do not”.
I demonstrated to Mike the pile I was going go make with the cards in my hand and we went to G2.

G2 . I kept a hand that could combo by turn 3, and I also had a Force of Will for any early
turns disruption he could have like {{Deafening Silence}} or hate-bears. If I remember
correctly I cast a {{Thoughtseize}} on turn 2 and discarded an {{Endurance}}. I also saw 
2 {{Knight of the Reliquary}}. Mike drew 3 extra cards with {{Sylvan Library}} over the
next two turns, casts a {{Choke}} which I countered, then I cast {{Doomsday}}. He again
asked me if he was dead, I said the same thing “yes if you don’t have any interactions”
and they conceded. We talked a bit about the MU and then I was done.

Ended 7-2 in the event, really enjoyed my matches, all my opponents were really nice to
interact and were very pleasant, can’t wait for big events to become a normal thing again
in the future when things are safer.


### Nathan Anderson Stahl (VendillionMisclique) - 27th Place (7-2)

Deck style: Grixis Turbo Meandeck.
[Decklist](https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/167298)

"My general decision to play Doomsday for the Pit open was based on a gut feeling
that Ragavan decks would be less popular in paper and my general dislike for the card.
I didn't have very much experience with combo and got 100% of my list from Kai and 
followed his stream religiously over the past few months. Unfortunately I was wrong
about my general impression of the metagame, there was a bunch of monkey buisness.
Despite with facing some bad matchups and my relative inexperience as a pilot, the deck
felt bonkers. One thing I will say is while the Bant/4C matchup feels close when I play
online many of the pilots in this event seemed to not have a good understanding of
matchup dynamics. Plenty of {{Endurance}}s cast at the wrong time and {{Pyroblast}}s
burned on cantrips."

#### Round 1 vs Matt Brown on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2).

This guy had {{Snapcaster Mage}}s, {{Price of Progress}}, and 3 {{Flusterstorms}} in the board.
I got lucky to win G1 without a real understanding of what was going on but G2/3 were not close. 

#### Round 2 vs Kevin Brenneman on {U}{W}{G} Control. Win (2-1).

Game one was quick. They tapped out for a t2 {{Sylvan Library}} when I had {{Daze}} in hand, was
able to go off holding up multiple pieces of interaction. Game 2 I got smacked down by an early 
{{Wasteland}} x {{Life from the Loam}} lock. I questioned if I should board out the Shelldock Emmy 
plan but chose to leave it in. This paid off in the final game where I cast {{Duress}} to see {{Force of Will}}
+ multiple {{Endurance}}. I was able to play it slow with Emrakul and won but it was close. They got
two dredges to look for the one-of {{Wasteland}}.

#### Round 3 vs Mason Slate on {B}{R} Reanimator. Win (2-0).

G1 I played {{Lotis Petal}} into a {{Chancellor of the Annex}} trigger so that I could cast discard 
on t1 to take an {{Entomb}}. After that they went for an {{Animate Dead}} line on {{Grief}} to put us
both hellbent, but a 2/1 doesn't do a great job as the only clock. Cantrips in the deck meant 
I was able to outdraw them from there and easily win.

G2 They mulled into oblivion. 

#### Round 4 vs Jacob Saracino on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-1).

G1 was close, they had turn 1 Ragavan and off the first cantrips I saw straight gas.
Unfortunatly I had to let them cast spells.... I avoided this once by casting a Personal Tutor
for {{Edge of Autumn}} they chose not to attack which was odd and it ended up enabling a same turn kill. 

G2 got blown away.

G3 Probably the coolest game of the tournament for me. Both of us keep 7 and do nothing but 
cantrip for the first few turns. I know their hand has to be mono interaction but at this point 
my opener had two {{Pact of Negation}} and I've drawn into the full playset. We go draw go
for a couple turns making land drops at which point my hand is 4 Pact, {{Dark Ritual}}, 2 Cyclers.
I topdeck the {{Doomsday}} and resolve through hardcast {{Force of Negation}}, Force pitch {{Daze}}, 
and {{Pyroblast}} at which point they have two unkowns in hand. I made a big punt here by putting 
myself dead to double {{Daze}}. I wasn't recognizing that they had tapped out for the FON and I didn't 
need to empty my library. Realised it as soon as I cast the {{Ideas Unbound}}. Thankfully they only
had one {{Daze}} and I got away with one. 

#### Round 5 vs Andrew Nguyen on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2).

Game one was pretty masterful, same turn kill at the last possible moment to win at one life.

G2 wasn't close. 

G3 They had tapped out for {{Delver of Secrets}} and I {{Brainstorm}} into the nuts. 
I resolved a {{Doomsday}} using double {{Dark Ritual}} off Petal to {{Duress}} them first. 
Seeing mono cantrips {{Force of Will}} and {{Daze}}. Had to take Force and leave them
with {{Daze}} but at this point I can't beat much. I played it too slow and lost to a 
Delver flip off {{Lightning Bolt}}. In hindsight I should have waited a few turns to go off. 
This exposes me to {{Wasteland}} but none of the piles I could build from that low on resources
could effectively fight an onboard threat plus {{Wasteland}} anyhow.  

#### Round 6 vs Ryan Pugh on {U}{W}{G}{R} Control. Win (2-1).

Game 1 was uneventful. 

Game 2 I mull to 5 and lost to an early {{Sylvan Library}}.

Game 3 was my second big punt. I didn't realize they had an onboard {{Karakas}} tucked in with
their other lands! Made a Pile that would have lost to {{Endurance}} when I could easily have 
put them on 0 outs with an {{Ideas Unbound}} that drew in to {{Pact of Negation}}. 

#### Round 7 vs Mark Kelley on {U}{W}{G} Control. Win (2-1).

G1 Not much to say here. 

G2 I tried to resolve {{Doomsday}} on turn 1 with plenty of backup but they played
{{Flusterstorm}}. Given how big a blowout that play was, the game was actually rather close.
Think I put 3 copies of {{Doomsday}} on the stack total. 

Game 3 was another regrettable situation involving {{Karakas}} but this time they played it 
from hand. However I only had the {{Doomsday}} in my yard and went to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}}
with one card in library to win through {{Endurance}}. Pretty sure that they could have
hardcast that {{Endurance}} earlier to kill me..... 

#### Round 8 vs Stephen Dupal on Elves. Win (2-0).

G1 They played heath go. I didn't know exactly what they were on but resolved turn 1 {{Doomsday}} with
{{Undeground Sea}} and a fetch in hand. Made the following pile to beat {{Wasteland}} + 
{{Thalia, Guardian of Thraben}} over two turns.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!Volcanic Island}}</row>

They knew they couldn't win and so just chose to not reveal what deck they were on. I assumed 
{G}{W} depths. 

G2 they {{Thoughtseize}} twice, and made in my mind a poor choice to take {{Dark Ritual}} over
a {{Preordain}} in a situation where my only other draw spells were cyclers. The {{Preordain}}
let me dig to a {{Brainstorm}} that ended the game. 

#### Round 9 vs Matthew Czuzak on Madness. Win (2-1).

G1 lost after playing around a topdecked {{Burning Inquiry}}, they discarded {{Anger}}, 
{{Vengvine}} and played two Hollow Ones to kill from 10 life. 

G2 I kept a super interactive hand where I was able to {{Daze}}, Force the enablers. 
I then drew some cantrips while they were stuck doing nothing and won easily. 

G3 Went to 5 for a hand of {{Ponder}}, {{Force of Negation}}, land, {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}.
They kept a hand reliant on a turn one {{Faithless Looting}} that I Forced. Draw land 
for turn and resolved {{Doomsday}} for an easy turn 2 win. 


### Nicholas French-Seats (germancouch) - 59th Place (6-3)

Deck style: Grixis Turbo Meandeck.
[Decklist](https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/163733)
*Note: MtGMelee has a mistake and the {{Vapor Snag}} should be a {{Chain of Vapor}}.

"I don’t have a ton of notes about each match other than what I played against
but I’ll try to recall anything notable. In terms of prep was I played at least
one or two matches daily on cockatrice two weeks leading up to the tournament 
and Kai’s stream/Youtube was super helpful in terms of learning lines and the 
thought process of the deck."

#### Round 1 vs Kyle Dorgan on Karnforge. Loss (1-2).

Rd 1 Colorless Karn Echo (the mesmeric orb+basalt monolith deck): W 2-1
Nothing to note here.  Typical combo matchup for DD where I bought time with counterspells to get a same turn win with Doomsday.

Rd 2 UR Delver: W 2-1
Lost G1 due to delver doing delver things.  Games 2 and 3 he kept hands high on interaction but no threat which weren’t difficult to beat.

Rd 3 UR Delver: W 2-0
G1 had a quick DD through force+daze with duress+force backup and made a ptt pile that passed twice and played around most things except something like triple bolt or threat+double bolt.  G2 he just kept a hand with daze and no threat.  Something of note in that G2 that happens in paper play that you don’t get online is after I doomsday’ed through his daze he sort of slumped in his chair which I read as he didn’t have anything else to fight back so I went for the same turn kill in lieu of a ptt pile.  It ended up being the case that he didn’t have anything but that could have been a nutty bluff too.
Rd 4 RW Painter: W 2-0
Both games I had some really good hands that went off quick with protection.  G1 he plays ancient den->pass which I read as not a force deck so I just jammed.  G2 had counters for anything that mattered and jammed a pile that wins on the same turn.
Outside the game note: this round had a random deck check for our table where I got pulled aside for my list being different than the deck I was presenting.  Mtg Melee was struggling for ~36 hours up to the event including right up to the event start so I was confident there was an issue with the site and me manually inputting my deck.  I had triple-checked the list prior to driving out to the event and it matched up with what was in my deck so I’m not sure where/when the mixup happened.  I was able to defend my position to the judges while also being respectful of their position and fortunately didn’t get a game loss.

Rd 5 ANT: W 2-0
Again, typical combo vs doomsday matchup.  It was interesting and fun playing discard battles again though because you don’t get to play thoughtseize/duress mirrors in current legacy as much.

Rd 6 4c Bant Control: L 1-2
G1 was a T2 or T3 doomsday with backup.  He had endurance but force+pact was enough.  G2 I never saw a 2nd land after cantripping pondering twice and brainstorming so I was stuck on volcanic island the whole game and fell way behind.  I was finally able to doomsday and make a pile that could win if my opp egregiously misplays more than once but I messed up the chances by not piling emrakul 2nd so I could shelldock.  First misbuilt pile of the day.  G3 was just a series of clunky draws that were enough to resolve a doomsday but couldn’t beat the pyroblast in his hand that hit my brainstorm and left the emrakul stranded in my hand while he beat down with his collector ouphe.
Rd 7 UR Delver: L 0-2
This match felt like how the UR delver matchup should go.  Had a ptt pile g1 that he triple bolted me out of.  G2 I had a turn that I think I could have won through but misplayed.  After cantripping+IU I had rit, doomsday, thoughtseize, pact, street wraith, and pyroblast.  I thoughtseize them and see blast x2 and FoW x3.  I took one of the forces but I think I should have taken one of the blasts.  I don’t remember how much mana I had open or know if there is a same-turn winning pile post-doomsday resolving through 1x blast+3x force with that hand but I couldn’t have beaten 2x blast with that hand anyway so I should have taken the blast.  I was in a bad spot that game anyway but I closed the door on myself.  On the whole with the UR delver matchup it seemed as though this opp knew how to play against DD whereas my previous 2 opp didn’t have as many reps against the deck.  Keeping a hand that goes T1 ponder and a bunch of interaction but no early threat is a good way to lose a good matchup against DD which is what both of my previous delver opponents did.

Rd 8 Moon Stompy: L 0-2
Got absolutely run over this match.  It was one of those matches where stompy had everything and can keep jamming threats+lock pieces to run you out of resources.  They had jeska’s will in the list though which I thought was cool.

Rd 9 Elves: W 2-1
G1 I doomsday’ed quick but punted hard but not putting IU in the pile.  (Pile punt count #2) That made me have to pass the turn 3 times against elves which is a death sentence even with a force.  Games 2 and 3 I had T2 or T3 doomsdays after some interaction or with protection.
Closing thoughts:
Playing in a big paper tournament again was a blast and I hope to get in more like it soon.  This was easily the biggest tourney I’ve been in since the pandemic started with the next closest being a 45 player modern $2k in August.  Everyone I interacted with just seemed stoked to be there.  The pit staff were also respectful in my experience.  I’ve heard concerns from other players about not enough precautions for a tournament this size during covid and the only other precaution I could think to do would be follow what other concerts/festivals are doing in requiring proof of vaccination or a negative covid test within 72 hours at the door.

Concerning the deck, doomsday felt like a great pick for the tourney.  9 rounds of doomsday didn’t feel that crazy from a mentally taxing standpoint and I’d 100% choose playing this deck for the next big tournament.  Getting the reps in and memorizing the majority of common piles went a long way in consolidating mental energy throughout the tournament.  Only egregiously misbuilding 2 piles in retrospect across 9 rounds of magic could be worse but also can be improved upon for sure.  On the note of list changes, I don’t know how I feel about the emrakul+shelldock plan anymore.  Emrakul rotting in your hand is real bad, has happened to me in multiple games, and bant has been preparing for the emrkaul plan now with karakas, dress down, back to basics, etc.  I’m going to cut that package from the board and see how that goes next time.  The maindeck island was also meh in it didn’t cast doomsday and it didn’t protect me from wasteland that much anyway when the opp can just waste my sea and I’m back at no black mana.  Now that consider is legal too I’m looking forward to trying consider+deep analysis which brings me to my list changes.
Maindeck:
-Taking out the island and replacing it with either a watery grave or the 9th fetch
-making room for some number of consider+deep analysis.  Probably going to start with cutting preordain + trimming some cyclers and see where that goes.

Sideboard:
-Cutting nausea.  Against elves I didn’t seem to need it and I have massacre against DnT.
-Cutting the emrakul+shelldock plan and going to try the double-oracle plan for endurance decks.
-Adding another pact of negation and a spell pierce into the remaining open slots.
