title: Doomsday at the Legacy Pit Open - An interview with RomarioVidal
---

## Preface

Last weekend (weekend of September the 18th 2021) The Legacy Pit hosted the
Legacy Pit Open, a large competetive event for Legacy in the US. The event 
was very successful and a number of people have already written reports / write
ups of their tournament experience. A number of archetypes were represented
including a number of people out to jam some Doomsday in paper. We approached
those who were part of the online community and asked if anyone was willing to
write up a report of their event and we had a brilliant response with 4 pilots
submitting reports for this article and 1 of them even offering to talk over
the experience in an interview too!

For the wider meta and to follow the decklists within the event it can all be
found online along with the organiser's website (they produce a lot of good
content so please check them out!):

## The Interview with Romario

Linked below you can find a link to the interview I (Doishy) had with Romario
Vidal. This was a great chat and covered his thoughts going into the event, 
his deck choice decisions, the event itself and future thoughts including
how {{Consider}} might be changing the lists pilots run. The interview is 
just under 2 hours (1 hour 49 minutes) and has been cleaned up to hopefully
make it palatable for the ears. Currently it is only available on Youtube because
unfortunately the payment model on SoundCloud means we cannot upload any additional
content on there without paying for the priviledge. Please do have a listen if
you have time!

## The Player's Reports

We had 4 players submit reports which you will be able to read below. Overall
Doomsday had a very good showing in the event, despite the high numbers of
{U}{R} Delver and Ragavan decks in general. With 11 pilots Doomsday, had around
a 3% meta share and boasted an impressive 58.54% match win rate (without mirror). 
This was the best performance of any deck with a playerbase >10 in the event so
a huge well done to all the player's collective performance. 

The players who were able to submit a report were RomarioVidal, VendillionMisclique,
germancouch and Ruta Barracuda so a huge thank-you to them for being willing
to take the time to provide those reports. There were also some other great results
from other players but they were not able to find the time to submit anything.

"This past weekend the guy from The Legacy Pit hosted an 
event in Frederick MD, this was the first large event since
the start of the pandemic in NA. The tournament was only a
few hours away driving from my house and, like a lot of other
legacy enthusiasts, I was itching to play some paper legacy.

The general perception was the meta was being dominated by 
Ragavan/DRC/Urza's Saga decks. Out of those 3, Ragavan represented 
the biggest threat to my deck of choice: Doomsday. I didn’t 
really do any extensive testing or preparation for the event
due to some family schedule changes and some other personal 
businesses, but I was did play a good number of leagues and 
tried a few different deck configurations. Eventually I settled
on the “Kai Sawatari” Doomsday list, it’s the list most 
similar to the lists I was familiar and have had some previous 
good results.

So onto the event, we were required to submit decklists and register
ahead of time since there wouldn’t be any in-person registration, 
with that being said I registered the Wednesday before the event."

#### Round 1 vs Sam Roukas on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Loss (0-2).

G1 I kept a hand that could cast Doomsday with {{Force of Will}} but there 
were no lands. If I remember correctly this was my opening 7: 2x {{Lotus Petal}},
{{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Force of Will}}, {{Daze}}.
I am also on the draw in this game. They played a {{Wasteland}} and passed the 
turn. On my turn I cast Petal > {{Thoughtseize}}, I see double {{Daze}},
{{Expressive Iteration}} and some lands, I took a {{Daze}}; I cast {{Dark Ritual}}
into {{Doomsday}}, now the pile I ended up building was what I like to call
the DnT pile, 2x fetches, {{Thassa's Oracle}} and 2 fetchable lands. This pile
would lose to a second piece of countermagic but it would beat removal,
the {{Daze}} I knew about and {{Wasteland}}. They drew a {{Force of Will}}
and we went to play g2.

G2 Nothing really interesting happened in this game I took a long time to find 
{{Doomsday}} while Ragavan kept attacking by the time I found {{Doomsday}} it 
was too late.

#### Round 2 vs Denver Rapp on {U}{B} Reanimator. Win (2-0).

This deck was a bit of a brew but it had all the good cards you would expect
to see in an reanimator deck plus some {{Show and Tell}} and some tin fins elements.

G1 I saw a basic Swamp and an {{Entomb}}, that was it. When I went for the combo
they seemed to just have f6’d. I sideboarded for {B}{R} reanimator.

G2 Opponent caught me off guard when they played a basic Island into {{Careful Study}},
I sideboarded out some of my discard spells but now I realized I am playing against 
a deck that is also playing countermagic. Luckily they were able to put {{Iona, Shield of Emeria}}
in the graveyard but not reanimate it back before I could resolve {{Thassa’s Oracle}}.

#### Round 3 vs Derek Toth on Urza Echo. Win (2-0).

G1. This is another game that I didn’t get the  right deck my opponent was playing.
They cast a {{Chalice of the Void]] on turn one off a {{City of Traitors}} which I
countered. I cast {{Doomsday}} the following turn and make a pile that can beat 
anything but a {{Trinisphere}}, they don’t cast anything and just pass the turn,
{{Thassa’s Oracle}} enters the battlefield and we reach for our sideboards. I thought
my opponent was on mono {R} stompy but in this case I think I would still SB the same way.

G2. They had sort of a slow start just casting some baubles but nothing else until after
I resolved {{Doomsday}}, they cast a {{Karn, the Great Creator}}, I let it resolve even though
I had {{Force of Negation}}, {{Force of Will}} and a blue card in hand. They minus Karn 
to get a {{Tormod’s Crypt}} then try to flashback an {{Echo of Eons}} with a {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}.
I countered and won on the following turn.

<row variant="pile">{{!Urza, Lord High Artificer}}</row>

#### Round 4 vs Tony Murate (Into_Play) on Mono {G} Cloudpost. Win (2-0).

This round I played against the great and powerful Tony Murata aka into_play 
on mtgo, well known caster of {{Primeval Titan}}s.

G1. So this is one of the best MUs for {{Doomsday}}, it’s not say you can’t lose
as the combo player, with the printing of {{Endurance}} things got a lot more tricky.
I wasn't expecting much interaction from Tony’s side of the table before board and 
made a pretty basic {{Brainstorm}} pile.

G2. I boarded in the {{Emrakul, the Aeon's Torn}} + {{Shelldock Isle}} plan in this game.
I knew it could be a bad idea since they play cards like {{Pithing Needle}}, {{Karakas}}
and possibly {{Wasteland}}/{{Ghost Quarter}}. I cast {{Doomsday}} on turn 2, the pile
I made was {{Brainstorm}} (Emrakul was in my hand), {{Shelldock Isle}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}},
{{Underground Sea}} and {{Doomsday}}. I put shelldock in play on turn 3, Tony cast a
{{Crop Rotation}} when Emrakul resolves, I countered and he conceded. The idea here was 
to have a second {{Doomsday}} to refill my deck in case I needed to attack twice with Emrakul.

#### Round 5 vs Bob Huang (Griselpuff) on {U} Urza Affinity. Loss (1-2).

Played against legacy master Bob Huang, earlier in the day I asked if he was on Delver he told me 
Affinity. Honestly I thought was trolling me for a second, it turns out he was not.

G1 . I mulled to 6 trying to find a hand that could cast a quick Doomsday, but I wasn’t able to
put {B}{B}{B} and {{Doomsday}} together before a couple of constructs reduced my life total to 0.

G2 . I tried basically the same plan as game 1 but this time I was able to combo before getting 
attacked down to 0.

G3 . I found the combo pieces a turn too late, but overall I think this was one of the MUs I
hadn’t played any matches against it, I didn’t really approach the games correctly.

<row variant="pile">{{!Thought Monitor}}</row>

#### Round 6 vs Matthew Hackbirt (TheHackbert) on Cephalid Breakfast. Win (2-0).

Played against another great player from Arizona, the awesome Matt Hackbert.

G1 . Last time I talked to Matt he was playing Tin Fins/Ice Station Zebra type of decks
but he was also posting in the Doomsday discord. I was able to combo kinda early in the
game, and the only cards I saw were a couple cantrips and a {{Cabal Therapy}}.

G2 . I thought Matt was on some kind of combo and I was right I just wasn’t expecting
cephalid breakfast. Funny part is I kept a hand with 3 {{Doomsday}}, the only thing I 
kept thinking was “If he plays a Therapy I am conceding before he even names “Doomsday”.
Matt made a small mistake that ended up costing him the game and therefore the match.

#### Round 7 vs Jeffrey Carr on {U}{R} Sagavan. Win (2-1).

Things started getting interesting from this round on, at least in terms of tournament 
prize. Earlier in the day the tournament organizers announced they expanded the prize 
support to anyone who finished X-3 or better. At this point I had 2 losses, which meant
I could only lose 1 match in the last 3 rounds if I wanted to at least make my entry 
fee money back. You can imagine I was very thrilled to face probably the worst MU for Doomsday.

G1 . Now this is getting late in the day, I am starting to get a bit tired, not writing
notes means I am not 100% on these boardstate and play sequences but I am going to to my 
best. This game was decided by an early {{Doomsday}} and later a {{Thassa’s Oracle}} with
some {{Force of Will}} back up, but my opponent didn’t actually have any interactions
besides the {{Daze}} they had for my Doomsday.

G2 . I lost to a {{Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer}}, plus {{Wasteland}} and {{Murktide Regent}}.
I did cast a late {{Thoughtseize}} for some extra information and saw a {{Torpor Orb}}
in my opponent’s hand.

G3 . I was able to resolve {{Doomsday}} and make a pile that ended with me casting
{{Thassa’s Oracle}} off {{Cavern of Souls}}. Barring some {{Stifle}} shenanigans this
pile was perfect for this scenario, and now the dream to cash the event was still alive.

#### Round 8 vs Christian Fuller on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-0).

Well, as it turns out I was going to have to play against some hard MU in these last rounds.

G1 . This was kinda funny, both me and my opponent just mulliganed into oblivion.
My opener was 5 lands (mixed of {{Underground Sea}} and fetches) {{Ponder}} and {{Daze}},
after that I saw two hands without lands, both me and my opponent decided to pile shuffle.
I stopped at 4 and they went down to 3 cards, I kept a hand resilient to {{Wasteland}} and
it could cantrip. The hand I see after casting {{Duress}} is 3x {{Wasteland}}s. I ended
up winning this game but my opponent came really close to making up the card disadvantage
from the mulligan.

G2. I used the SB plan for Delver, and {{Pact of Negation}} really shined in the combo turn.
It felt super rewarding to win this and the previous round. This also meant I was guaranteed
to get my entry fee money back and now I was going to play for some extra $45.

<row variant="pile">{{!Dragon's Rage Channeller}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Michael Mapson on {G}{W} Depths. Win (2-0).

In this round I played someone who I considered to be one of the nicest people I have met 
playing this game Michael Mapson. Mike hosts a podcast about Modern and Legacy, he also
has been putting really good results with this Depths variant, by the way this is 
also another mu doomsday is favored. To be honest I was kinda relieved I wouldn’t have 
to play against Ragavan for the third time in a row.

G1 . Like I said previously this is a mu Doomsday is favored, much in the same way Doomsday
is favored against Mono {G} Post but now you do have to have a plan for {{Endurance}}.
I wasn’t very familiar with the stock 75 for this deck but I suspected they weren’t 
playing {{Endurance}} in the main deck. I cast doomsday, Mike asked me if he was dead
to which I replied “yes if you don’t have any interaction” they said “I do not”.
I demonstrated to Mike the pile I was going go make with the cards in my hand and we went to G2.

G2 . I kept a hand that could combo by turn 3, and I also had a Force of Will for any early
turns disruption he could have like {{Deafening Silence}} or hate-bears. If I remember
correctly I cast a {{Thoughtseize}} on turn 2 and discarded an {{Endurance}}. I also saw 
2 {{Knight of the Reliquary}}. Mike drew 3 extra cards with {{Sylvan Library}} over the
next two turns, casts a {{Choke}} which I countered, then I cast {{Doomsday}}. He again
asked me if he was dead, I said the same thing “yes if you don’t have any interactions”
and they conceded. We talked a bit about the MU and then I was done.

#### Closing thoughts:

Ended 7-2 in the event, really enjoyed my matches, all my opponents were really nice to
interact and were very pleasant, can’t wait for big events to become a normal thing again
in the future when things are safer.


### Nathan Anderson Stahl (VendillionMisclique) - 27th Place (7-2)

Deck style: Grixis Turbo Meandeck.
[Decklist](https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/167298)

"My general decision to play Doomsday for the Pit open was based on a gut feeling
that Ragavan decks would be less popular in paper and my general dislike for the card.
I didn't have very much experience with combo and got 100% of my list from Kai and 
followed his stream religiously over the past few months. Unfortunately I was wrong
about my general impression of the metagame, there was a bunch of monkey buisness.
Despite with facing some bad matchups and my relative inexperience as a pilot, the deck
felt bonkers. One thing I will say is while the Bant/4C matchup feels close when I play
online many of the pilots in this event seemed to not have a good understanding of
matchup dynamics. Plenty of {{Endurance}}s cast at the wrong time and {{Pyroblast}}s
burned on cantrips."

#### Round 1 vs Matt Brown on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2).

This guy had {{Snapcaster Mage}}s, {{Price of Progress}}, and 3 {{Flusterstorms}} in the board.
I got lucky to win G1 without a real understanding of what was going on but G2/3 were not close. 

#### Round 2 vs Kevin Brenneman on {U}{W}{G} Control. Win (2-1).

Game one was quick. They tapped out for a t2 {{Sylvan Library}} when I had {{Daze}} in hand, was
able to go off holding up multiple pieces of interaction. Game 2 I got smacked down by an early 
{{Wasteland}} x {{Life from the Loam}} lock. I questioned if I should board out the Shelldock Emmy 
plan but chose to leave it in. This paid off in the final game where I cast {{Duress}} to see {{Force of Will}}
+ multiple {{Endurance}}. I was able to play it slow with Emrakul and won but it was close. They got
two dredges to look for the one-of {{Wasteland}}.

#### Round 3 vs Mason Slate on {B}{R} Reanimator. Win (2-0).

G1 I played {{Lotis Petal}} into a {{Chancellor of the Annex}} trigger so that I could cast discard 
on t1 to take an {{Entomb}}. After that they went for an {{Animate Dead}} line on {{Grief}} to put us
both hellbent, but a 2/1 doesn't do a great job as the only clock. Cantrips in the deck meant 
I was able to outdraw them from there and easily win.

G2 They mulled into oblivion. 

<row variant="pile">{{!Entomb}}</row>

#### Round 4 vs Jacob Saracino on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-1).

G1 was close, they had turn 1 Ragavan and off the first cantrips I saw straight gas.
Unfortunatly I had to let them cast spells.... I avoided this once by casting a Personal Tutor
for {{Edge of Autumn}} they chose not to attack which was odd and it ended up enabling a same turn kill. 

G2 got blown away.

G3 Probably the coolest game of the tournament for me. Both of us keep 7 and do nothing but 
cantrip for the first few turns. I know their hand has to be mono interaction but at this point 
my opener had two {{Pact of Negation}} and I've drawn into the full playset. We go draw go
for a couple turns making land drops at which point my hand is 4 Pact, {{Dark Ritual}}, 2 Cyclers.
I topdeck the {{Doomsday}} and resolve through hardcast {{Force of Negation}}, Force pitch {{Daze}}, 
and {{Pyroblast}} at which point they have two unkowns in hand. I made a big punt here by putting 
myself dead to double {{Daze}}. I wasn't recognizing that they had tapped out for the FON and I didn't 
need to empty my library. Realised it as soon as I cast the {{Ideas Unbound}}. Thankfully they only
had one {{Daze}} and I got away with one. 

#### Round 5 vs Andrew Nguyen on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2).

Game one was pretty masterful, same turn kill at the last possible moment to win at one life.

G2 wasn't close. 

G3 They had tapped out for {{Delver of Secrets}} and I {{Brainstorm}} into the nuts. 
I resolved a {{Doomsday}} using double {{Dark Ritual}} off Petal to {{Duress}} them first. 
Seeing mono cantrips {{Force of Will}} and {{Daze}}. Had to take Force and leave them
with {{Daze}} but at this point I can't beat much. I played it too slow and lost to a 
Delver flip off {{Lightning Bolt}}. In hindsight I should have waited a few turns to go off. 
This exposes me to {{Wasteland}} but none of the piles I could build from that low on resources
could effectively fight an onboard threat plus {{Wasteland}} anyhow.  

#### Round 6 vs Ryan Pugh on {U}{W}{G}{R} Control. Win (2-1).

Game 1 was uneventful. 

Game 2 I mull to 5 and lost to an early {{Sylvan Library}}.

Game 3 was my second big punt. I didn't realize they had an onboard {{Karakas}} tucked in with
their other lands! Made a Pile that would have lost to {{Endurance}} when I could easily have 
put them on 0 outs with an {{Ideas Unbound}} that drew in to {{Pact of Negation}}. 

<row variant="pile">{{!Swords to Plowshares}}</row>

#### Round 7 vs Mark Kelley on {U}{W}{G} Control. Win (2-1).

G1 Not much to say here. 

G2 I tried to resolve {{Doomsday}} on turn 1 with plenty of backup but they played
{{Flusterstorm}}. Given how big a blowout that play was, the game was actually rather close.
Think I put 3 copies of {{Doomsday}} on the stack total. 

Game 3 was another regrettable situation involving {{Karakas}} but this time they played it 
from hand. However I only had the {{Doomsday}} in my yard and went to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}}
with one card in library to win through {{Endurance}}. Pretty sure that they could have
hardcast that {{Endurance}} earlier to kill me..... 

#### Round 8 vs Stephen Dupal on Elves. Win (2-0).

G1 They played heath go. I didn't know exactly what they were on but resolved turn 1 {{Doomsday}} with
{{Undeground Sea}} and a fetch in hand. Made the following pile to beat {{Wasteland}} + 
{{Thalia, Guardian of Thraben}} over two turns.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!Volcanic Island}}</row>

They knew they couldn't win and so just chose to not reveal what deck they were on. I assumed 
{G}{W} depths. 

G2 they {{Thoughtseize}} twice, and made in my mind a poor choice to take {{Dark Ritual}} over
a {{Preordain}} in a situation where my only other draw spells were cyclers. The {{Preordain}}
let me dig to a {{Brainstorm}} that ended the game. 

<row variant="pile">{{!Nattle Sentinel}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Matthew Czuzak on Madness. Win (2-1).

G1 lost after playing around a topdecked {{Burning Inquiry}}, they discarded {{Anger}}, 
{{Vengvine}} and played two Hollow Ones to kill from 10 life. 

G2 I kept a super interactive hand where I was able to {{Daze}}, Force the enablers. 
I then drew some cantrips while they were stuck doing nothing and won easily. 

G3 Went to 5 for a hand of {{Ponder}}, {{Force of Negation}}, land, {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}.
They kept a hand reliant on a turn one {{Faithless Looting}} that I Forced. Draw land 
for turn and resolved {{Doomsday}} for an easy turn 2 win. 


### Nicholas French-Seats (germancouch) - 59th Place (6-3)

Deck style: Grixis Turbo Meandeck.
[Decklist](https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/163733)
*Note: MtGMelee has a mistake and the {{Vapor Snag}} should be a {{Chain of Vapor}}.

"I don’t have a ton of notes about each match other than what I played against
but I’ll try to recall anything notable. In terms of prep was I played at least
one or two matches daily on cockatrice two weeks leading up to the tournament 
and Kai’s stream/Youtube was super helpful in terms of learning lines and the 
thought process of the deck."

#### Round 1 vs Kyle Dorgan on Karnforge. Win (2-1).

Nothing to note here. Typical combo matchup for DD where I bought time with counterspells to get a same turn win with Doomsday.

#### Round 2 vs Austin Blackner on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-1).

Lost G1 due to Delver doing Delver things.  

Games 2 and 3 he kept hands high on interaction but no threat which weren’t difficult to beat.

#### Round 3 vs Maximilian Sagraves on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-0).

G1 had a quick {{Doomsday}} through {{Force of Will}}+{{Daze}} with {{Duress}} + {{Force of Will}}
backup and made a ptt (pass-the-=turn) pile that passed twice and played around most things except
something like triple {{Lightning Bolt}} or threat + double bolt.  

G2 he just kept a hand with {{Daze}} and no threat. Something of note in that G2 that 
happens in paper play that you don’t get online is after I Doomsday’ed through his {{Daze}} he
sort of slumped in his chair which I read as he didn’t have anything else to fight back
so I went for the same turn kill in lieu of a ptt pile. It ended up being the case that he
didn’t have anything but that could have been a nutty bluff too.

<row variant="pile">{{!Delver of Secrets}}</row>

#### Round 4 vs Michael Morris on {R}{W} Painter. Win (2-0).

Both games I had some really good hands that went off quick with protection.
G1 he plays {{Ancient Den}}->pass which I read as not a Force deck so I just jammed.

G2 had counters for anything that mattered and jammed a pile that wins on the same turn.

Outside the game note: this round had a random deck check for our table where I got pulled aside for
my list being different than the deck I was presenting.  Mtg Melee was struggling for ~36 hours up 
to the event including right up to the event start so I was confident there was an issue with the 
site and me manually inputting my deck.  I had triple-checked the list prior to driving out to the 
event and it matched up with what was in my deck so I’m not sure where/when the mixup happened.  I 
was able to defend my position to the judges while also being respectful of their position and
fortunately didn’t get a game loss.

#### Round 5 vs Tyler Carden on ANT. Win (2-0).

Again, typical combo vs Doomsday matchup.  It was interesting and fun playing discard battles 
again though because you don’t get to play {{Thoughtseize}}/{{Duress}} mirrors in current legacy as much.

#### Round 6 vs Dennis Hillyer on {U}{W}{G}{R} Control. Loss (1-2).

G1 was a T2 or T3 {{Doomsday}} with backup. He had {{Endurance}} but {{Force of Will}}+{{Pact of Negation}}
was enough. 

G2 I never saw a 2nd land after cantripping, Pondering twice and Brainstorming so I was stuck on
{{Volcanic Island}} the whole game and fell way behind. I was finally able to {{Doomsday}}
and make a pile that could win if my opp egregiously misplays more than once but I messed up the 
chances by not piling Emrakul 2nd so I could {{Shelldock Isle}}. First misbuilt pile of the day. 

G3 was just a series of clunky draws that were enough to resolve a doomsday but couldn’t beat the
{{Pyroblast}} in his hand that hit my brainstorm and left the Emrakul stranded in my hand while
he beat down with his {{Collector Ouphe}}.

<row variant="pile">{{!Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath}}</row>

#### Round 7 vs Michael Horn on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (0-2).

This match felt like how the {U}{R} delver matchup should go. Had a ptt pile g1 that he triple 
bolted me out of.  

G2 I had a turn that I think I could have won through but misplayed. After cantripping + casting 
{{Ideas Unbound}} I had {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Pact of Negation}},
{{Street Wraith}} and {{Pyroblast}}. I {{Thoughtseize}} them and see Blast x2 and FoW x3. 
I took one of the Forces but I think I should have taken one of the Blasts.  I don’t remember
how much mana I had open or know if there is a same-turn winning pile post-Doomsday resolving 
through 1x blast+3x force with that hand but I couldn’t have beaten 2x blast with that hand anyway 
so I should have taken the blast. I was in a bad spot that game anyway but I closed the door on myself. 

On the whole with the {U}{R} delver matchup it seemed as though this opp knew how to play against
Doomsday whereas my previous 2 opponents didn’t have as many reps against the deck.  Keeping a hand
that goes T1 Ponder and a bunch of interaction but no early threat is a good way to lose a good matchup
against Doomsday which is what both of my previous delver opponents did.

#### Round 8 vs Anrew Arconti on Moon Stompy. Loss (0-2).

Got absolutely run over this match. It was one of those matches where stompy had everything 
and can keep jamming threats+lock pieces to run you out of resources. They had {{Jeska’s Will}}
in the list though which I thought was cool.

<row variant="pile">{{!Blood Moon}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Landon Handerson on Elves. Win (2-1).

G1 I Doomsday’ed quick but punted hard but not putting {{Ideas Unbound}} in the pile. (Pile punt count #2) 
That made me have to pass the turn 3 times against Elves which is a death sentence even with a Force. 

Games 2 and 3 I had T2 or T3 Doomsdays after some interaction or with protection.

#### Closing thoughts:

Playing in a big paper tournament again was a blast and I hope to get in more like it soon.
This was easily the biggest tourney I’ve been in since the pandemic started with the next closest being a
45 player modern $2k in August. Everyone I interacted with just seemed stoked to be there. The pit staff 
were also respectful in my experience. I’ve heard concerns from other players about not enough precautions 
for a tournament this size during covid and the only other precaution I could think to do would be
follow what other concerts/festivals are doing in requiring proof of vaccination or a negative covid test
within 72 hours at the door.

Concerning the deck, Doomsday felt like a great pick for the tourney. 9 rounds of doomsday didn’t feel that
crazy from a mentally taxing standpoint and I’d 100% choose playing this deck for the next big tournament. 
Getting the reps in and memorizing the majority of common piles went a long way in consolidating mental energy
throughout the tournament. Only egregiously misbuilding 2 piles in retrospect across 9 rounds of Magic could 
be worse but also can be improved upon for sure. On the note of list changes, I don’t know how I feel about the
Emrakul + Shelldock plan anymore. Emrakul rotting in your hand is real bad, has happened to me in multiple games,
and Bant has been preparing for the Emrakul plan now with {{Karakas}}, {{Dress Down}}, {{Back to Basics}}, etc.
I’m going to cut that package from the board and see how that goes next time. The maindeck Island was also meh
in it didn’t cast Doomsday and it didn’t protect me from {{Wasteland}} that much anyway when the opp can just 
waste my Sea and I’m back at no black mana. Now that {{Consider}} is legal too I’m looking forward to trying 
{{Consider}} + {{Deep Analysis}} which brings me to my list changes.

Maindeck:
- Taking out the {{Island}} and replacing it with either a {{Watery Grave}} or the 9th fetch.
- Making room for some number of {{Consider}} + {{Deep Analysis}}. Probably going to start with 
cutting {{Preordain}} + trimming some cyclers and see where that goes.

Sideboard:
- Cutting {{Nausea}}. Against elves I didn’t seem to need it and I have {{Massacre}} against DnT.
- Cutting the Emrakul + Shelldock plan and going to try the double-Oracle plan for {{Endurance}} decks.
- Adding another {{Pact of Negation}} and a {{Spell Pierce}} into the remaining open slots.


### Dave Boruta (Ruta Barracuda) - 106th Place (5-4)

Deck style: Grixis Stifle Turbo Meandeck.
[Decklist](https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/162172)

"The Legacy Pit Open (LPO for short) was my first Legacy tournament in over a year and a half.
To give some background, before my daughter was born in March, 2020, I decided that the MTG 
First 2K and the Dice City Revised Open would be my last bits of competitive Magic for a long 
time. At some point after my daughter was born, I grinded leagues on MTGO with Meandeck Doomsday
in the Oko meta with the older, more controlling version of Meandeck Doomsday, and I performed 
quite well with it until I had to focus more on family life. Up until this point, I had played
Doomsday in paper only once at my local meta, Curio Cavern, in June of 2021, and I had not played
any matches with the Turbo version I ran at the LPO. So, going into the week before the tournament, 
I would not have played more than 2-3 matches with Doomsday, no matches with the Turbo version,
and a grand total of 6 matches of Legacy in 2021, period.

To prepare for the tournament, I first had to decide whether I wanted to stick with the controlling 
version of Doomsday that had fallen out of favor or move to the turbo version. I didn’t really have 
the time or the desire to get back on MTGO, so I paid close attention to what Kai Sawatari (Sawatarix),
Max Carini (Wonderpreaux), and Ethan Formichella (Monkeyscantcry) were running.  Max’s {{Stifle}}
version was very appealing to me since it appeared to enable an easier pivot between controlling 
and turbo modes of the deck, and it also appeared to fit better with substituting {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}
for {{Personal Tutor}}. The choice to run {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} over {{Personal Tutor}} was personal 
preference, but I also am simply unwilling to spend hundreds of dollars in paper for a card that 
in my view only provides a marginal advantage over the alternative. The same decision was also made
in designing the sideboard – I wasn’t terribly enthusiastic about spending $400 for a set of {{Force of Negation}},
so with a lot of help from Max, I crafted a sideboard for this event that would fit well for the expected meta.  

When some of the Nothern VA Legacy crew got together at Bob Huang’s place to test, I jumped at the chance
to get some reps in to prepare for this tournament. I tested Doomsday vs. {U}{R} Ragavan Tempo matchup 
quite a bit with Dan Signorini and Kyle Pittleman, and it didn’t seem as bad as I had imagined. 
It became incredibly obvious after the first couple games that going fast with countermagic/disruption 
before the Ragavan deck could establish itself was the way Doomsday wins the matchup.   

After testing and more discussion with Max, I decided on the list below for the LPO. I felt the slotting 
for boarding for the various decks that make up the current meta was very straightforward in this build, 
which was intended to make things easier on me during the LPO."

#### Round 1 vs Mark Marra on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Win (2-1).

Round 1 of the tournament began with me facing Mark Marra on 
Jeskai Tempo, with me on the play.  So, welcome back to Legacy – let’s start with a tough 
matchup right out of the gates. I was able to take Game 1 largely due to casting an end-step
{{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} that spurred an exchange where my opponent cast {{Daze}} and {{Force of Will}}. 
I was lucky enough to find Doomsday off {{Brainstorm}} the following turn and already had Dark Ritual
in hand. That let me build a pile that could win through {{Wasteland}} and the active Ragavan on board 
while losing to {{Force of Will}} #2 + blue card (which I felt wasn’t likely): 

<row variant="pile">{{SW}} {{!Volcanic Island}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}}</row>

In: {{Cavern of Souls}},  2 {{Duress}}, {{Abrade}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

Game 2 was very close and involved a lot of decision-making with cantrips trying to find disruption,
mana, and {{Doomsday}}. I ended up making a misplay at one point with my cantrip decisions with Ragavan
on the board, as I figured out after the fact that I needed double {{Daze}} to win and lost one of my 
{{Daze}}s to Ragavan. 

Game 3, I got lucky on a mull to 4 that had a turn 1 {{Doomsday}} with {{Daze}} backup. I decided to build
a 2-turn pile that would lose to {{Wasteland}}.

<row variant="pile">{{CoS}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

I was able to fade Wasteland and got there.

#### Round 2 vs Patrick Humfleet on {G}{W} Depths. Win (2-0).

Again, I was on the play.  Game 1 was fast – an opening {{Thoughtseize}} showed me I was clear
to go for a fast kill. By turn 2, I had 2 cyclers, {{Dark Ritual}}, and {{Doomsday}} in hand with 
no mana floating after Doomsday. A pile of LED, IU, {{Lotus Petal}}, {{Pact of Negation}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}}
enabled the same turn win with 2 cyclers in hand. 

<row variant="pile">{{LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!PoN}} {{!TO}}</row>

In: {{Echoing Truth}}, 2 {{Abrade}}
Out: 2 {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Preordain}}

Game 2, my opponent and I both mulled to 6, and my opponent came out with a plan to just race me 
with a fast Marit Lage. This is one game where {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} found me a win where {{Personal Tutor}}
wouldn’t. By Patrick’s third end-step, he had assembled the combo. I cast {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} then,
holding {{Brainstorm}}, cycler, and {{Lotus Petal}}, and land in hand. After paying 10 life 
(so looking through practically my entire deck!) I was able to find a Vault pile that would win 
the game for me in {{Stifle}}, {{Doomsday}}, cycler, {{Dark Ritual}}, X.  On my turn, I drew 
{{Stifle}} and passed to my end step, where I cast {{Stifle}} on {{Thespian's Stage}} activation. 
In Patrick’s end step, I cast {{Brainstorm}} and put cycler and land on top. On my turn, I drew the
2nd cycler and won using the same pile as game 1.

<row variant="pile">{{!Dark Depths}}</row>

#### Round 3 vs Anthony Arevalo on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Loss (1-2).

Anthony is a regular at Dice City Games, the other store in the DC Metro Area that has a highly 
competitive Legacy meta, and I recognized his playmat and vaguely recognized him under his mask from 
monthly tournaments at DC Games.  

Game 1 was quite strange, in that Anthony never fetched a red source, only {{Tundra}}s, presumably to
hide what he was on; we exchanged {{Stifle}}s on fetches and {{Wasteland}}, and I eventually found 
the combo with disruption in the form of {{Thoughtseize}} and {{Force of Will}} backup to win with 
a pass the turn pile using {{Ideas Unbound}}.  

In: {{Cavern of Souls}},  2 {{Duress}}, {{Abrade}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

I remember Game 2 being a slog, with us again trading {{Stifle}}s on fetches/{{Wasteland}}, my having 
to deal with an initial Ragavan with {{Abrade}} out of the sideboard. This was followed up by Anthony
with a second continuously *dashed* Ragavan that I was unable to deal with. I made a critical mistake 
with my cantrip decisions at this point that cost me the game, as I piled my {{Ponder}}s incorrectly twice
– the first, giving away a land I actually would have needed, and the second giving up a {{Daze}} that 
I originally thought would have had no impact, but after I saw Anthony using his Ragavan Treasures 
right away and was tapping out each turn, meant having double {{Daze}} would likely have won me the match.
So, by the time I was able to cast {{Doomsday}} and win the same turn, I was at 1 life, meaning I lost the game.

Game 3 was low impact from my side – I was able to disrupt with an early {{Stifle}} into a follow-up {{Duress}}
to buy time, but my cantrips simply kept hitting more discard and air rather than finding me {{Doomsday}}.  
By the time I was able to find {{Doomsday}}, Anthony had stabilized and started finding {{Wasteland}}s and 
threats to quickly diminish my life total.  

#### Round 4 vs Bryant Cook on TES. Loss (0-2).

Bryant was a friendly face in the tournament and one of the many players I was hoping to be able to play 
with that I used to have great games with on MTGO. We both knew what each other was playing; I was very 
familiar with Bryant’s entire list, and I was pretty sure Bryant knew I was on Max’s {{Stifle}} version of 
Doomsday from our chats before the tournament that day. I would like to have said I played these games as
well as I could, but that wouldn’t be true. The problem with not having played much Magic at all for over 
a year is that you start feeling fatigued earlier in a tournament than you would have if you were keeping
up playing. This was probably my worst played match of the day. As a result, it’s also the match I remember 
the best, since I have thought about how I could have played it better since then.   
  
Game 1, I kept a slow hand of {{Ponder}}, 2x {{Force of Will}}, {{Street Wraith}}, Fetchland, Fetchland, and 
was on the play. Against any other deck and player, I would have said this would have been a fine keep. Against 
Bryant on TES, I should have looked for a faster combo hand, since that is how {{Doomsday}} wins the 
Storm matchup. I opened with fetching for an {{Underground Sea}} and cast {{Ponder}} – I believe I shuffled that 
{{Ponder}} and drew {{Lotus Petal}. Bryant had a very fast start as expected and was able to play out much of his
mana as expected and cast {{Ponder}}. On my turn, I drew {{Brainstorm}} and cast it to find another {{Brainstorm}},
a second {{Street Wraith}}, and a land –  no second blue card to hold up double FoW.  I put {{Lotus Petal}} and 
Land back on top and played out a second fetchland. Bryant cast {{Wishclaw Talisman}} on his turn, which I attempted 
to counter with {{Force of Will}} (pitching {{Brainstorm}}).  He responded with {{Veil of Summer}}, which I had expected
to happen. I cracked the fetch to get a shuffle and felt good about playing to my outs with two {{Street Wraith}}s in hand.
With Veil on the stack, I cycled the first {{Street Wraith}}, which drew another {{Street Wraith}}. I then cycled the
remaining two into cards that were not blue, and I lost the match to natural Tendrils off the Wishclaw. One note is
that if I had let Wishclaw resolve, Bryant had enough mana on board to be able to kill me through an {{Ad Nauseam}}
line with ease, so the Wishclaw was a must counter with the expectation that I would also have to counter a 
{{Veil of Summer}} in response.
  
In: 2 {{Duress}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}
Out: 2 {{Pact of Negation}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

In Game 2, Bryant mulled to 6 while I mulled to 5 – {{Stifle}}, {{Force of Will}}, {{Flusterstorm}}, {{Street Wraith}}, 
{{Underground Sea}}. Not ideal, workable. Unfortunately, I played this game horribly. I started by cycling {{Street Wraith}}
to find a cantrip, but hit another land instead. I played out the {{Underground Sea}} and passed. Bryant has a less 
explosive start with fetch, pass. I draw {{Doomsday}}, play out my second land and pass for turn. Bryant led his turn on
{{Brainstorm}}, then played a Taiga (representing Veil in my mind) then played out Petal, LED, and {{Mox Opal}} into 
{{Wishclaw Talisman}}. At this point in game 2, I should have been playing more patiently, but I decided to go with a 
high risk, high reward play that in retrospect was a poor decision made out of a feeling of desperation from being on 
a mull to 5  – I was going to make a bluff to try to steal Bryant’s Wishclaw from him by letting it resolve 
(thus representing I didn’t {{Force of Will}} even when I did) because he had two cards left in hand at that
point by my counting. One would be presumably {{Veil of Summer}}, and the other potentially {{Dark Ritual}}.
So, when Bryant cast {{Veil of Summer}}, I responded with {{Flusterstorm}} – perhaps too quickly. I was surprised 
when he stopped right there, although after reading his tournament report, I can see why he stopped now. Next turn,
I drew a third land, which was unexpected. I quickly played it, and I figured at that point, that was my window
to try to go for a win by casting {{Doomsday}} and building a fastest-killing pass-the-turn pile I could (IU, 
Edge, Land, TO, X) while holding up {{Force of Will}} on Bryant’s turn. 

<row variant="pile">{{IU}} {{!EoA}} {{!Underground Sea}} {{!TO}} {{!Island|RAV}}</row>

What I should have thought more carefully about was the possibility of Bryant having {{Echo of Eons}} in hand,
which he did and led on the following turn. Now my problem was my pile, while drawn if I survived a turn would win
me the match, was not built to handle an Echo of Eons and could only counter one spell, assuming I drew {{Force of Will}}
in my fresh 7. I should have let it resolve anyway, but I instead countered it, and that exact amount of life loss let
Bryant kill me with a natural Tendrils. It was a huge misplay, but I also played that whole game incredibly poorly.

I talked with both Max and Romario after the match about Game 2 specifically, and they had different takes. 
Max was of the opinion that I did have to go for a {{Doomsday}} there because I was so far behind, but I should 
have jam packed my pile with counter magic and that way let {{Echo of Eons}} resolve to keep Bryant off the win.
Romario was of the opposite opinion, that I should have waited, since I had the ability to {{Force of Will}} or {{Stifle}}
and could potentially draw into a same turn kill. After the match, Bryant and I also talked a little about game 2, 
and he shared Max’s opinion that I should have let {{Echo of Eons}} resolve and counter the payoff spells post-Echo. 
It’s a tough choice, either way, but I think in the end that Romario was right and I should have waited to cast Doomsday.

<row variant="pile">{{!Wishclaw Talisman}}</row>

#### Round 5 vs Kyle Souza on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2).

I was on the draw and kept a slow 6, not knowing what Kyle was on. I can’t recall exactly what my hand 
was Game 1, other than I had {{Force of Will}}, land, and multiple cantrips. I opened with fetch for 
{{Underground Sea}}, {{Ponder}}, which I shuffled, and passed. I recall Kyle opening on a DRC. 
On the following turns, I spun my wheels while getting Wastelanded out of the game. By the time I
recovered, Kyle had Delerium turned on with DRC, eventually flipped a Delver, and was able to 
close the game out with a series of burn spells.  

In: {{Cavern of Souls}},  2 {{Duress}}, {{Abrade}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}  

Game 2, I kept a really fast 7 that consisted of {{Volcanic Island}}, Fetch, Fetch, {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}},
{{Stifle}}, {{Daze}}. I couldn’t ask for a better 7 against Delver. Kyle mulled to 6. I went turn 1 playing my 
fetchland and passed. On Kyle’s turn, I cast {{Stifle}} on his fetchland. On my turn, I drew another {{Daze}}. 
I played the other fetchland, cracked it for {{Underground Sea}}, cast {{Dark Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}}, and 
passed with my pile being {{Ideas Unbound}}, {{Edge of Autumn}}, {{Lotus Petal}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}}, {{Cavern of Souls}}.

<row variant="pile">{{IU}} {{!EoA}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}} {{!CoS}}</row>

Kyle untapped, played another fetchland, cast {{Ponder}}, and passed.  I cast {{Ideas Unbound}}, played
{{Lotus Petal}}, cycled into Cavern on Merfolk, and cast an uncounterable {{Thassa’s Oracle}} for the win.  

Game 3, I was on a mull to 5, but found a quick hand of Fetchland, {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Daze}}.  
I drew into a second {{Daze}} after Kyle opened with {{Volcanic Island}} into {{Delver of Secrets}}.  On my turn,
I cracked the fetch for {{Underground Sea}}, cast {{Dark Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}}. I built a pile to beat 
{{Wasteland}} but would require fading 2 turns to so: Fetchland, Edge, TO, Cavern, {{Volcanic Island}}.  

<row variant="pile">{{Polluted Delta}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!CoS}} {{!Volcanic Island}}</row>

Unfortunately, that didn’t matter – Kyle revealed {{Brainstorm}} to flip Delver, played {{Volcanic Island}}
#2, then attacked with Delver. He cast {{Lightning Bolt}}, which I Dazed and he Dazed back, then he cast
{{Lightning Bolt}} #2 for the win.  

#### Round 6 vs Michael Fajardo Evangelista on Elves. Win (2-0).

I lost the die roll and saw an opener of Yavimaya into {{Quirion Ranger}}. Elves is generally a 
favorable matchup assuming I can race game 1, which I could. I had mulled to a 6 that had
land, land, {{Dark Ritual}}, cantrip, LDV, {{Daze}} I drew into {{Ponder}}, and cast it turn 1, 
finding {{Doomsday}}. The following turn, Michael cast {{Nettle Sentinel}} and another {{Quirion Ranger}}.
I untapped, drew into a blank, played a land and cast {{Doomsday}}. I made a cycler pile into {{Thassa’s Oracle}}.
Next turn, Michael tried to find a way to go off by leading on {{Elvish Visionary}}, which I Dazed to win 
game 1 when I untapped.  

In:  2 {{Flusterstorm}}, 2 {{Duress}}
Out: 4 {{Daze}}

Game 2, I kept a 6 that I think was {{Flusterstorm}}, {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Underground Sea}}, 
fetchland, and {{Doomsday}}. I remember Michael also mulling to 6 and leading on {{Thoughtseize}}. The following 
turn, I Thoughtseized back, seeing he had a slow hand. I took his {{Elvish Visionary}} and passed. 
On his turn, Michael played out some of the 1-drop creatures from his hand and passed. On my turn, I cast 
{{Brainstorm}} and drew into {{Doomsday}}, {{Lotus Petal}}, and a {{Volcanic Island}}. I cast {{Dark Ritual}}
into {{Doomsday}} off the fetched {{Underground Sea}} and built the following pile: {{Ideas Unbound}}, {{Stifle}}
(for {{Endurance}} off {{Allosaurus Shepherd}}), {{Lotus Petal}}, {{Edge of Autumn}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}}. 
I ended up not needing the {{Stifle}}, since my opponent couldn’t find a {{Glimpse of Nature}} or {{Natural Order}}. 

<row variant="pile">{{IU}} {{!Stifle}} {{!LP}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}}</row>

#### Round 7 vs Zach Felix on Elves. Win (2-1).

Game 1 went in my favor rather quickly, despite being on the Draw. I kept a six that had {{Dark Ritual}}, 
{{Daze}}, {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}, {{Underground Sea}}, Fetch, {{Ponder}}. Zach opened with {{Quirion Ranger}} turn 1.
Back to back Elves felt like a boon after facing 3 Ragavan decks earlier in the tournament. I played 
{{Underground Sea}} and cast {{Ponder}} to find a {{Force of Will}}. Zach’s second turn involved playing
a {{Quirion Ranger}} and {{Nettle Sentinel}}. I played a fetch and passed. Zach didn’t draw any engine cards,
so he played a couple more creatures and swung for a few points of damage. In his end step, I cast {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}
and found {{Doomsday}} right away. When I untapped, I cast {{Doomsday}} and made a cycler pile. 
The following turn, Zach didn’t topdeck a win, so I was able to cast {{Thassa’s Oracle}} without issue the following turn.

In:  2 {{Flusterstorm}}, 2 {{Duress}}
Out: 4 {{Daze}}

Game 2 was much more interactive. Zach kept his 7, and I think I mulled to 6 again that had a turn 1 
{{Dark Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}} with no backup, but had cantrips. Zach opened on {{Thoughtseize}}, taking {{Doomsday}}, 
leaving me to have to dig. Zach continued building his board turn 2 and ran his Grist into a {{Daze}} while I found 
nothing off my {{Brainstorm}}, leaving me with blue card and {{Street Wraith}} in hand. By turn 3, Zach got the 
Glimpse engine online and drew into {{Craterhoof Behemoth}}, which cast that same turn. I cracked my fetchland
to clear the top of my library, then cycled with {{Street Wraith}} playing to my outs for a {{Force of Will}},
which I did not draw.

Game 3, I kept a strong 7 that, with cantrips, got me to a turn 2 {{Doomsday}} with {{Force of Will}} backup. At this 
point, my memory is a bit fuzzy, but I think Zach mulled twice. It didn’t end up mattering, but I misbuilt my {{Doomsday}}
pile to be a pass-the-turn where I had one blue mana open. I likely could have built a pile of {{Brainstorm}} (cycler in hand),
LED, cycler, TO, X, X. It would have left me open to {{Endurance}}, though, so I decided to go with {{Ponder}}, {{Ideas Unbound}},
Land, Petal, TO to hold up {{Force of Will}} on {{Endurance}} (which he didn’t have in hand) to win.

<row variant="pile">{{Pn}} {{!IU}} {{!Underground Sea}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

#### Round 8 vs Juanmanuel Angulo on Ninjas. Win (2-1).

Game 1, we both kept 7’s. At this point in the tournament, I honestly couldn’t recall what my 7 was, other than it had 
FoW, cantrips, {{Dark Ritual}}, and land. My opponent opened to {{Underground Sea}}, {{Ponder}}, pass. So at first 
I thought I was in a combo mirror. I cast a {{Ponder}} on my turn as well. My opponent cast another cantrip and then played 
out {{Ornithopter}}. Ok, I’m facing {{Ninjas}} - not a great matchup, actually kinda bad. On my turn, I find the combo 
and set up a pass the turn pile with {{Ideas Unbound}}. My opponent ninjitsus in Yuriko on his turn and hits me 
for a decent amount, but not enough to keep me from winning the following turn. 

In: {{Cavern of Souls}},  2 {{Duress}}, {{Red Elemental Blast}}, {{Pyroblast}}, {{Flusterstorm}}
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

Game 2, I mulled to a quick 6, and my opponent also mulled to 6.  He opened with {{Thoughtseize}} taking {{Doomsday}}, 
then played out 2 {{Ornithopter}}s. My cantrips were unable to find another {{Doomsday}} in the following turns, 
meaning I quickly died to a board of ninjas.  

Game 3, I kept a slower 7 that was full of disruption.  My opponent mulled to 5. I opened on {{Thoughtseize}],
taking his {{Force of Will}}. He played out his two {{Ornithopter}}s and passed.  On my turn, I cantripped to 
find {{Doomsday}} and left mana open to {{Stifle}} ninjitsu, which I did the following turn. My next draw was a 
{{Red Elemental Blast}}, which I used on Yuriko the next time it entered the battlefield.  When I untapped, 
I found the third land for Doomsday, had Cavern in hand, and made a cycler pile that won me the match the following turn. 

<row variant="pile">{{!Changeling Outcast}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Daniel McCaulley on Urza Echo ft. Painter Transformation. Loss (1-2).

Game 1 was weird - I kept a 7 that just needed me to find {{Dark Ritual}} and I had {{Force of Will}} backup. 
My opponent started out fast into an Emry that whiffed. The next turn, I find the ritual and immediately cast
{{Doomsday}}, making a cycler pile to cast {{Thassa’s Oracle}} with {{Force of Will}} backup. My opponent
spins his wheels the following turn, not top decking well.  

In: 2 {{Abrade}}, {{Red Elemental Blast}}, {{Pyroblast}}, {{Cavern of Souls}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}, 2 {{Duress}}, {{Echoing Truth}}
Out: 2 {{Stifle}}, 2 {{Pact of Negation}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}, 2 {{Street Wraith}}, 2 {{Lotus Petal}}

Game 2, we both mull to 6. My opponent opens with {{Painter’s servant}} naming {W}, which is not what I want to see
with a grip full of Red Blasts and cantrips. On my turn, I draw {{Force of Will}} and play a fetch land. My opponent
casts {{Grindstone}} on his turn, which is met with {{Force of Will}} from me. He forces back, I Red Blast his force, and he Forces again.
The next time he untaps, I lose.  

Game 3, I mull to 5 looking for a quick {{Doomsday}, which I don’t find. Instead, I have {{Abrade}}, Petal, Fetch, Cantrip, 
{{Dark Ritual}}.  I cantrip turn 1 and shuffle to draw {{Street Wraith}}.  My opponent plays turn 1 Painter.  Turn 2, I
attempt to {{Abrade}} and am met with {{Force of Will}}.  From there, the game gets away from me as my opponent plays
{{Urza’s Saga}} and finds {{Grindstone}} off it over the next couple turns while I cantrip and find nothing good.

#### Closing thoughts:

Playing Doomsday in paper felt just as easy as online to me, except I found myself choosing piles quicker to not
get accused of stalling or slow play; not that I found cause to feel that way in this tournament. 
I do think, though, that there were several instances where I would have made better decisions if those same
games had been played on MTGO because I would be able to talk myself through those lines out loud - something
one really can’t do in paper.  
 
I would say the weirdest part of playing Doomsday in paper was using copies from Weatherlight and having 
to explain the Oracle text was updated to sequence resolution differently starting in 6th edition.  I was asked
the same thing about {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} and struggled to explain the changes, even though at this point I 
knew how it is supposed to resolve from playing it on MTGO. I suggested we call a judge to get the Oracle text,
but my opponent declined and said he was just curious.  
 
Overall, I was happy to have gone 5-4 after playing almost no Magic at all since October 2020, although it is
clear to me I could have played better and may have finished better if I had played sharper/tighter.  I felt that 
the Doomsday/Ragavan Tempo matchup is much closer than I had expected it to be, though I do feel like I have Dan and 
Kyle to thank for quickly bringing me up to speed on that matchup. I think that overall, the deck is still well-positioned 
in this meta.  It’s not quite as well-positioned as it was in the Oko meta, but I would say it is still the top combo deck.
The Legacy Pit meta showed Doomsday coming out to a 54% win rate (thanks to Jesse Hatfield for analysis), which was right in 
the same ballpark as the Ragavan decks. Also, after the tournament, Alex Rubin posted that he saw {{Torpor Orb}} a lot out 
of his opponents’ sideboards, validating my choice to run {{Abrade}}, even if I dodged {{Torpor Orb}} myself. So overall,
I think my deck choice was solid, as were my sideboard card choices.  
 
After the tournament, I got some barbecue in Frederick with some of my NoVA and RVA friends. The food was pretty good, 
and it felt a bit surreal that we were able to go have dinner with friends after playing Magic all day. It was honestly great
getting to play Legacy in paper again and great to hang out with old friends. The Legacy Pit put on a great tournament, 
and I felt safe with the mask enforcement.  I look forward to being able to do this in the future.


## One Last {{Consider}}ation

And there we have it! A big thank-you to all our contributors who submitted reports for this article. 
As I said there were 11 players for Doomsday overall and it's great to see so many choosing it
for such a big event.

One final thing to note is the Wiki has now been updated with instructions on how to integrate
{{Consider}} into your pile building. For those unaware {{Consider}} is a new card which
allows for a couple of things. First of all it allows existing {{Brainstorm}} + Cycler + X
piles or {U} + Cycler Piles + X piles to now go down to 0 cards left in deck. 

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!Consider}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back X then Consider
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Consider
1. Cast Consider, put X into the graveyard and draw TO
1. Cast TO with the remaining mana from LED with zero cards left in your library

This also allowss you to create very mana/card efficient piles with the help of
{{Deep Analysis}}. If you have {U} and either {{Consider}} or a cycler in hand
you can build the following:

> {U} + Consider

<row variant="pile">{{!DA}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Consider, surveil the DA and draw LED. 
1. Cast LED, crack it for {U}{U}{U} and flashback DA to draw SW and LP
1. Cycle SW, draw the TO
1. Cast LP and cast TO with the LP and the final {U} from the LED with zero cards left in your library

For the cycler variant just remove the SW from the pile and put {{Consider}} on the top.

We will of course try to update other content including default decklists and relevant interactions when
we have time/enough data to do so.
