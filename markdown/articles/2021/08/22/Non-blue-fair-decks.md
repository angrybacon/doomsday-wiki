Gude!

This time i want to talk how our Gameplan against Non Blue Fair Decks looks like and how to execute it.
All these matchups have one common point, a fast Doomsday is always good and the post Doomsday part of the game is far more interesting.

!EXCLAIMER! I don't give any sideboard guides in these articles. Sideboard guides don't help anyone learning to play a deck, because you first have to know how to play the deck to know how to sideboard correctly.

## Death and Taxes

### Gameplan

Slam early and build your pile around mana and card draw denial.

### Cards to keep in mind

#### Maindeck

<row variant="hand"> {{!Kaldra Compleat}} {{!Spirit of the Labyrinth}} {{!Rishadan Port}} {{!Wasteland}} {{!Solitude}}</row>

#### Sideboard

<row variant="hand"> {{!Deafening Silence}} {{!Mindbreak Trap}} {{!Surgical Extraction}</row>

### Gameplay

#### Pre Doomsday

Against DnT resolving an early {{Doomsday}} is the safest way to win. Mulliganing for a Turn 1 or Turn 2 Doomsday is a good starting point.  
Longer games are their only reliable way to win. They deny our mana and hinder our cantrips.  
Game 1 they have no way to interact with your Doomsday on the stack, so you can just slam as early as possible.  
In post board games play around {{Mindbreak Trap}} when it's reasonable and keep countermagic ready to fight {{Deafening Silence}}.  

#### Post Doomsday 

it's very important to keep in mind, that your mana is your biggest weakness and that you can not rely on cyclers as tool to work through your pile.  
There are many possible piles, but one of the easiest, most tested and pretty {{Surgical Extraction}} proof pile is Fetchland, Fetchland, Thassa's Oracle, Land, Land.  
It gives you the necessary mana, thins the pile and goes down to 0 cards to play around {{Solitude}}. All without cyclers or cantrips that get stuck in your hand against a {{Spirit of the Labyrinth}}.  
It's also very customizable. For instance if they already build up some pressure, add a {{Massacre}} or a removal spell for {{Stoneforge Mystic}} to stay safe from {{Kaldra Compleat}}.  
When we are already talking about Kaldra Compleat, remember it has haste and represents 5 damage for 2 Mana out of a Stoneforge Mystic.  

## Maverick

### Gameplan

An early Doomsdays gives you enough time to build safe piles.

### Cards to keep in mind

#### Maindeck

<row variant="hand"> {{!Gaddock Teeg}} {{!Collector Ouphe}} {{!Endurance}} {{!Wasteland}} {{!Solitude}} {{!Dark Depths}</row>

#### Sideboard

<row variant="hand"> {{!Deafening Silence}} {{!Mindbreak Trap}} {{!Surgical Extraction}} {{!Choke}} {{!Thoughtseize}}</row>

### Gameplay

#### Pre Doomsday

The matchup against Maverick plays pretty similar to the DnT mactchup, but with a small but important difference, the "I-Win" Button {{Dark Depths}}. Luckily the Dark Depths lines are all very telegraphed and easy to spot.  
Also one important aspect to keep in mind is, they play many possible silverbullets and can fetch them very easily with {{Green Sun's Zenith}}.  
Since there are no real stock Maverick lists at the moment expect every possible sideboard silverbullet also in the maindeck.  

#### Post Doomsday 

Like against most green Decks {{Endurance}} is the only real threat to your easy win.  
That's why it's super important to build safe piles. As long as you resolved Doomsday early, there is no reason to get fancy.  
Fetches are strong against {{Wasteland}} and {{Collector Ouphe}}, so try to stay away from petals as your mana sources for {{Thassa's Oracle}}.  

## Lands

### Gameplan

Playing the long game is not a winning line.

### Cards to keep in mind

#### Maindeck

<row variant="hand"> {{!Ghost Quarter}} {{!Dark Depths}} {{!Crop Rotation}} {{!Wasteland}} {{!Rishadan Port}} {{!Urza's Saga}}</row>

#### Sideboard

<row variant="hand"> {{!Pyroblast}} {{!Sphere of Resistance} {{!Choke}} {{!Endurance}} </row>

### Gameplay

#### Pre Doomsday

Lands has super strong mana denial, even more in Game 2 and 3, and will propably always win the long game, but it can switch gears super fast thanks to {{Dark Depths}}.  
Based on that analysis a fast Doomsday is the way to go. But when you are mulliganing keep in mind, how strong countermagic is against their post sideboard hate pieces.

#### Post Doomsday 

You have 3 main objectives post Doomsday. Have enough mana to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}}. Beat {{Pyroblast}}. Beat {{Endurance}}. Building piles against Lands isn't always easy, and sometimes you have to take some risks, but if you play to your objectives in the priority they are listes above, you should be on a good way to win.  
You have to learn assess your opponents posibilities, that's not something you'll learn reading this guide. You need to play matches over matches to refine this skill. But i can give you list of usefull tools you propably have in your deck.  
Fetches are great to play around mana denial. You can "hide" you mana producing lands behind them while thinning your deck.  
Free Countermagic is your best tool against every form hate spells. From {{Endurance}} over {{Choke}} to {{Sphere of Resistance}}.  
Artifact mana is super good when you want to end the game fast and you know they don't have ways to mess with it.  
{{Cavern of Souls}} is an easy counter to Pyroblast.  
Bounce Spells are the way to go to beat a fast Marit Lage.  

## Mono-Green Cloudpost

### Gameplan

Just slam, and beat Endurance post Doomsday

### Cards to keep in mind

#### Maindeck

<row variant="hand"> {{!Endurance}} {{!Dark Depths}}</row>

#### Sideboard

<row variant="hand"> {{!Mindbreak Trap}}</row>

### Gameplay

#### Pre Doomsday

This will be a short one. Just cast Doomsday asap and play around possible {{Mindbreak Traps}} in sideboarded games. Like in any Dark Depths deck, their plays to creat a 20/20 are super telegraphed.

#### Post Doomsday 

They only have one card to interact with you, {{Endurance}}. You should always have enough time for a pile that beats Endurance and even plays around Mindbreak Trap.
