title: Different Perspectives - How a different view can help accrue advantage
---

## Introduction

The idea for this article has come from two different places. First of all was
discussions with someone in the community on how they could identify whether
they were facing poor variance, running a *sub-optimal* deck list or making play
mistakes after an unfortunate run of leagues. The second source was watching a
stream / vod of another player (Monkeyscantcry) where some interesting scenarios
came up. In each, they played very well and were rewarded for that play but
within each there were some small decision points or alternative routes
available to them that went unnoticed. It was only because I was removed from
the direct action (as an audience member) that I was fortunate enough to be able
to consider the alternative play pattern and let them know.

Because of these interesting scenarious and consideration on how to improve ones
own play I would like to discuss the benefits of play review, what makes for
informative watching in terms of streams and to discuss some examples that were
spotted.

## The Article Series that Never Was

The very first article I wrote for this site was called [Doomsday by Committee,
Setting the Scene](/articles/2018/01/03/doomsday-by-committee/). The intention
of it was for a group of players to view a scenario presented and give their
impressions and thought processes behind the decisions. The idea was of course a
complete rip-off of the TES *Infernal Tutoring* series. Due to alternative
interests in what to write, lack of enthusiasm from other players to help and a
generally niche playerbase at the time anyways the series never actually took
off beyond this first article. I think that this sort of series would still have
been useful and someone recently approached me for doing this sort of thing
again (but has probably forgotten and dropped the idea) however these days we
have a lot of good options as an alternative for exploring play options and
patterns.

The first port of call for the Doomsday community should always be the Discord.
We have dedicated puzzles channels for asking on pile building and play
scenarios but plenty of people ask ad-hoc questions on how they would sequence
opening hands and whether someone would keep or mull in a scenario. If in doubt
just feel free to ask with a screenshot. It might be you already have the answer
and just want confirmation or you feel a little out of your depth and would like
a guiding hand. Asking for help is never a bad thing and the community is very
welcoming and constructive in their responses.

The second port of call is watching streams or videos where people are
describing their thought processes. A good number of content creators can be
found in our [resources appendix]() but I want to highlight Nevilshute as one
who consistently makes very informative videos in which they articulate their
thought processes well within and help give an idea as to why they build their
lists in certain ways and why they make certain play choices. If you watch his
videos you can ask questions in the comments and he is always responsive with
thorough replies so you should be in good hands!

Another good player for this is emidln aka bja aka Adam4300, They will often be
found streaming in the Doomsday discord, normally at US friendly times. They
tend to build from scratch their list in each stream and talk through what they
are playing with and around from their opponent. Discord streaming has a huge
advantage in being able to have instantaneous 2-way verbal communication without
delay, unlike twitch, and thus if you are watching you can either chime in with
alternative play suggestions or ask for more information on any decision points
you are unsure on.

The third point of call is having a go at your own content creation. This is
sort of like an amalgamation of the previous 2 points. If you stream or make
videos of your play, whilst verbalising your decision process, you can both help
internalise these decisions to yourself by making you defend and reason each one
and also offer up a perfect avenue for others to comment on your play patterns /
decision making and offer tailored advice for where you could improve or seek
alternative lines.

We knew Predict was correct IU bad.
Wrong.
We knew card disadvantage from PT and LDV was bad.
Wrong.
We knew that you should only run one Oracle.
Wrong.


Scenario. Vs infect. They have trop, nexus tapped.
You have , sea. You ponder see Doomsday, Force, 
Ritual. Your hand is ritual, daze, brainstorm, edge, delta.


What's the play? Brainstorm into the DD plus force then go off
Edge into force and go off? 



Post Doomsday Vs ur Delver. 
You have one card left in library and cast oracle
Off cavern. They bolt the oracle. What's the play? 

"Guys i am very new to doomsday, what is the ideal pile if you are gonna go t1 dark ritual into doomsday?"
-Darthdog

"What is the best list/default list/best style?"
-Many people over time
Is an impossible question

- Why is it impossible to answer such simple generic questions with the deck.
