title: Doomsday at the Legacy Pit Open - An Interview with RomarioVidal
---

## Preface

Last weekend (weekend of September the 18th 2021) The Legacy Pit hosted the
Legacy Pit Open, a large competetive event for Legacy in the US. The event was
very successful and a number of people have already written reports / write ups
of their tournament experience. A number of archetypes were represented
including a number of people out to jam some Doomsday in paper. We approached
those who were part of the online community and asked if anyone was willing to
write up a report of their event and we had a brilliant response with 4 pilots
submitting reports for this article and 1 of them even offering to talk over the
experience in an interview too!

For the wider meta and to follow the decklists within the event it can all be
found online along with the organiser's website (they produce a lot of good
content so please check them out!):

## The Interview with Romario

Linked below you can find a link to the interview I (Doishy) had with Romario
Vidal. This was a great chat and covered his thoughts going into the event, his
deck choice decisions, the event itself and future thoughts including how
{{Consider}} might be changing the lists pilots run. The interview is just under
2 hours (1 hour 49 minutes) and has been cleaned up to hopefully make it
palatable for the ears. Currently it is only available on Youtube because
unfortunately the payment model on SoundCloud means we cannot upload any
additional content on there without paying for the priviledge. Please do have a
listen if you have time!

## The Player's Reports

We had 4 players submit reports which you will be able to read below. Overall
Doomsday had a very good showing in the event, despite the high numbers of
{U}{R} Delver and Ragavan decks in general. With 11 pilots Doomsday, had around
a 3% meta share and boasted an impressive 58.54% match win rate (without
mirror). This was the best performance of any deck with a playerbase >10 in the
event so a huge well done to all the player's collective performance.

The players who were able to submit a report were RomarioVidal,
VendillionMisclique, germancouch and Ruta Barracuda so a huge thank-you to them
for being willing to take the time to provide those reports. There were also
some other great results from other players but they were not able to find the
time to submit anything.

#### Round 1 vs Sam Roukas on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Loss (0-2)

G1. I kept a hand that could cast Doomsday with {{Force of Will}} but there were
no lands. If I remember correctly this was my opening 7: 2x {{Lotus Petal}},
{{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Force of Will}}, {{Daze}}. I
am also on the draw in this game. They played a {{Wasteland}} and passed the
turn. On my turn I cast Petal > {{Thoughtseize}}, I see double {{Daze}},
{{Expressive Iteration}} and some lands, I took a {{Daze}}; I cast {{Dark
Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}}, now the pile I ended up building was what I like to
call the DnT pile, 2x fetches, {{Thassa's Oracle}} and 2 fetchable lands. This
pile would lose to a second piece of countermagic but it would beat removal, the
{{Daze}} I knew about and {{Wasteland}}. They drew a {{Force of Will}} and we
went to play g2.

G2. Nothing really interesting happened in this game I took a long time to find
{{Doomsday}} while Ragavan kept attacking by the time I found {{Doomsday}} it
was too late.

#### Round 2 vs Denver Rapp on {U}{B} Reanimator. Win (2-0)

This deck was a bit of a brew but it had all the good cards you would expect to
see in an reanimator deck plus some {{Show and Tell}} and some tin fins
elements.

G1. I saw a basic Swamp and an {{Entomb}}, that was it. When I went for the
combo they seemed to just have f6’d. I sideboarded for {B}{R} reanimator.

G2. Opponent caught me off guard when they played a basic Island into {{Careful
Study}}, I sideboarded out some of my discard spells but now I realized I am
playing against a deck that is also playing countermagic. Luckily they were able
to put {{Iona, Shield of Emeria}} in the graveyard but not reanimate it back
before I could resolve {{Thassa’s Oracle}}.

#### Round 3 vs Derek Toth on Urza Echo. Win (2-0)

G1. This is another game that I didn’t get the right deck my opponent was
playing. They cast a {{Chalice of the Void}} on turn one off a {{City of
Traitors}} which I countered. I cast {{Doomsday}} the following turn and make a
pile that can beat anything but a {{Trinisphere}}, they don’t cast anything and
just pass the turn, {{Thassa’s Oracle}} enters the battlefield and we reach for
our sideboards. I thought my opponent was on mono {R} stompy but in this case I
think I would still SB the same way.

G2. They had sort of a slow start just casting some baubles but nothing else
until after I resolved {{Doomsday}}, they cast a {{Karn, the Great Creator}}, I
let it resolve even though I had {{Force of Negation}}, {{Force of Will}} and a
blue card in hand. They minus Karn to get a {{Tormod’s Crypt}} then try to
flashback an {{Echo of Eons}} with a {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}. I countered and won
on the following turn.

<row variant="centered">{{!Urza, Lord High Artificer}}</row>

#### Round 4 vs Tony Murate (Into_Play) on Mono {G} Cloudpost. Win (2-0)

This round I played against the great and powerful Tony Murata aka into_play on
mtgo, well known caster of {{Primeval Titan}}s.

G1. So this is one of the best MUs for {{Doomsday}}, it’s not say you can’t lose
as the combo player, with the printing of {{Endurance}} things got a lot more
tricky. I wasn't expecting much interaction from Tony’s side of the table before
board and made a pretty basic {{Brainstorm}} pile.

G2. I boarded in the {{Emrakul, the Aeon's Torn}} + {{Shelldock Isle}} plan in
this game. I knew it could be a bad idea since they play cards like {{Pithing
Needle}}, {{Karakas}} and possibly {{Wasteland}}/{{Ghost Quarter}}. I cast
{{Doomsday}} on turn 2, the pile I made was {{Brainstorm}} (Emrakul was in my
hand), {{Shelldock Isle}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}}, {{Underground Sea}} and
{{Doomsday}}. I put shelldock in play on turn 3, Tony cast a {{Crop Rotation}}
when Emrakul resolves, I countered and he conceded. The idea here was to have a
second {{Doomsday}} to refill my deck in case I needed to attack twice with
Emrakul.

#### Round 5 vs Bob Huang (Griselpuff) on {U} Urza Affinity. Loss (1-2)

Played against legacy master Bob Huang, earlier in the day I asked if he was on
Delver he told me Affinity. Honestly I thought was trolling me for a second, it
turns out he was not.

G1. I mulled to 6 trying to find a hand that could cast a quick Doomsday, but I
wasn’t able to put {B}{B}{B} and {{Doomsday}} together before a couple of
constructs reduced my life total to 0.

G2. I tried basically the same plan as game 1 but this time I was able to combo
before getting attacked down to 0.

G3. I found the combo pieces a turn too late, but overall I think this was one
of the MUs I hadn’t played any matches against it, I didn’t really approach the
games correctly.

<row variant="centered">{{!Thought Monitor}}</row>

#### Round 6 vs Matthew Hackbert (TheHackbert) on Cephalid Breakfast. Win (2-0)

Played against another great player from Arizona, the awesome Matt Hackbert.

G1. Last time I talked to Matt he was playing Tin Fins/Ice Station Zebra type of
decks but he was also posting in the Doomsday discord. I was able to combo kinda
early in the game, and the only cards I saw were a couple cantrips and a {{Cabal
Therapy}}.

G2. I thought Matt was on some kind of combo and I was right I just wasn’t
expecting cephalid breakfast. Funny part is I kept a hand with 3 {{Doomsday}},
the only thing I kept thinking was “If he plays a Therapy I am conceding before
he even names “Doomsday”. Matt made a small mistake that ended up costing him
the game and therefore the match.

#### Round 7 vs Jeffrey Carr on {U}{R} Sagavan. Win (2-1)

Things started getting interesting from this round on, at least in terms of
tournament prize. Earlier in the day the tournament organizers announced they
expanded the prize support to anyone who finished X-3 or better. At this point I
had 2 losses, which meant I could only lose 1 match in the last 3 rounds if I
wanted to at least make my entry fee money back. You can imagine I was very
thrilled to face probably the worst MU for Doomsday.

G1. Now this is getting late in the day, I am starting to get a bit tired, not
writing notes means I am not 100% on these boardstate and play sequences but I
am going to to my best. This game was decided by an early {{Doomsday}} and later
a {{Thassa’s Oracle}} with some {{Force of Will}} back up, but my opponent
didn’t actually have any interactions besides the {{Daze}} they had for my
Doomsday.

G2. I lost to a {{Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer}}, plus {{Wasteland}} and {{Murktide
Regent}}. I did cast a late {{Thoughtseize}} for some extra information and saw
a {{Torpor Orb}} in my opponent’s hand.

G3. I was able to resolve {{Doomsday}} and make a pile that ended with me
casting {{Thassa’s Oracle}} off {{Cavern of Souls}}. Barring some {{Stifle}}
shenanigans this pile was perfect for this scenario, and now the dream to cash
the event was still alive.

#### Round 8 vs Christian Fuller on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-0)

Well, as it turns out I was going to have to play against some hard MU in these
last rounds.

G1. This was kinda funny, both me and my opponent just mulliganed into oblivion.
My opener was 5 lands (mixed of {{Underground Sea}} and fetches) {{Ponder}} and
{{Daze}}, after that I saw two hands without lands, both me and my opponent
decided to pile shuffle. I stopped at 4 and they went down to 3 cards, I kept a
hand resilient to {{Wasteland}} and it could cantrip. The hand I see after
casting {{Duress}} is 3x {{Wasteland}}s. I ended up winning this game but my
opponent came really close to making up the card disadvantage from the mulligan.

G2. I used the SB plan for Delver, and {{Pact of Negation}} really shined in the
combo turn. It felt super rewarding to win this and the previous round. This
also meant I was guaranteed to get my entry fee money back and now I was going
to play for some extra $45.

<row variant="centered">{{!Dragon's Rage Channeler}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Michael Mapson on {G}{W} Depths. Win (2-0)

In this round I played someone who I considered to be one of the nicest people I
have met playing this game Michael Mapson. Mike hosts a podcast about Modern and
Legacy, he also has been putting really good results with this Depths variant,
by the way this is also another mu doomsday is favored. To be honest I was kinda
relieved I wouldn’t have to play against Ragavan for the third time in a row.

G1. Like I said previously this is a mu Doomsday is favored, much in the same
way Doomsday is favored against Mono {G} Post but now you do have to have a plan
for {{Endurance}}. I wasn’t very familiar with the stock 75 for this deck but I
suspected they weren’t playing {{Endurance}} in the main deck. I cast doomsday,
Mike asked me if he was dead to which I replied “yes if you don’t have any
interaction” they said “I do not”. I demonstrated to Mike the pile I was going
go make with the cards in my hand and we went to G2.

G2. I kept a hand that could combo by turn 3, and I also had a Force of Will for
any early turns disruption he could have like {{Deafening Silence}} or
hate-bears. If I remember correctly I cast a {{Thoughtseize}} on turn 2 and
discarded an {{Endurance}}. I also saw 2 {{Knight of the Reliquary}}. Mike drew
3 extra cards with {{Sylvan Library}} over the next two turns, casts a {{Choke}}
which I countered, then I cast {{Doomsday}}. He again asked me if he was dead, I
said the same thing “yes if you don’t have any interactions” and they conceded.
We talked a bit about the MU and then I was done.

#### Closing Thoughts

Ended 7-2 in the event, really enjoyed my matches, all my opponents were really
nice to interact and were very pleasant, can’t wait for big events to become a
normal thing again in the future when things are safer.

#### Round 1 vs Matt Brown on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2)

This guy had {{Snapcaster Mage}}s, {{Price of Progress}}, and 3
{{Flusterstorms}} in the board. I got lucky to win G1 without a real
understanding of what was going on but G2/3 were not close.

#### Round 2 vs Kevin Brenneman on {U}{W}{G} Control. Win (2-1)

Game one was quick. They tapped out for a t2 {{Sylvan Library}} when I had
{{Daze}} in hand, was able to go off holding up multiple pieces of interaction.
Game 2 I got smacked down by an early {{Wasteland}} x {{Life from the Loam}}
lock. I questioned if I should board out the Shelldock Emmy plan but chose to
leave it in.

This paid off in the final game where I cast {{Duress}} to see {{Force of Will}}
and multiple {{Endurance}}. I was able to play it slow with Emrakul and won but
it was close. They got two dredges to look for the one-of {{Wasteland}}.

#### Round 3 vs Mason Slate on {B}{R} Reanimator. Win (2-0)

G1 I played {{Lotis Petal}} into a {{Chancellor of the Annex}} trigger so that I
could cast discard on t1 to take an {{Entomb}}. After that they went for an
{{Animate Dead}} line on {{Grief}} to put us both hellbent, but a 2/1 doesn't do
a great job as the only clock. Cantrips in the deck meant I was able to outdraw
them from there and easily win.

G2 They mulled into oblivion.

<row variant="centered">{{!Entomb|ODY}}</row>

#### Round 4 vs Jacob Saracino on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-1)

G1 was close, they had turn 1 Ragavan and off the first cantrips I saw straight
gas. Unfortunatly I had to let them cast spells.... I avoided this once by
casting a Personal Tutor for {{Edge of Autumn}} they chose not to attack which
was odd and it ended up enabling a same turn kill.

G2 got blown away.

G3 Probably the coolest game of the tournament for me. Both of us keep 7 and do
nothing but cantrip for the first few turns. I know their hand has to be mono
interaction but at this point my opener had two {{Pact of Negation}} and I've
drawn into the full playset. We go draw go for a couple turns making land drops
at which point my hand is 4 Pact, {{Dark Ritual}}, 2 Cyclers. I topdeck the
{{Doomsday}} and resolve through hardcast {{Force of Negation}}, Force pitch
{{Daze}}, and {{Pyroblast}} at which point they have two unkowns in hand. I made
a big punt here by putting myself dead to double {{Daze}}. I wasn't recognizing
that they had tapped out for the FON and I didn't need to empty my library.
Realised it as soon as I cast the {{Ideas Unbound}}. Thankfully they only had
one {{Daze}} and I got away with one.

#### Round 5 vs Andrew Nguyen on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2)

Game one was pretty masterful, same turn kill at the last possible moment to win
at one life.

G2 wasn't close.

G3 They had tapped out for {{Delver of Secrets}} and I {{Brainstorm}} into the
nuts. I resolved a {{Doomsday}} using double {{Dark Ritual}} off Petal to
{{Duress}} them first. Seeing mono cantrips {{Force of Will}} and {{Daze}}. Had
to take Force and leave them with {{Daze}} but at this point I can't beat much.
I played it too slow and lost to a Delver flip off {{Lightning Bolt}}. In
hindsight I should have waited a few turns to go off. This exposes me to
{{Wasteland}} but none of the piles I could build from that low on resources
could effectively fight an onboard threat plus {{Wasteland}} anyhow.

#### Round 6 vs Ryan Pugh on {U}{W}{G}{R} Control. Win (2-1)

Game 1 was uneventful.

Game 2 I mull to 5 and lost to an early {{Sylvan Library}}.

Game 3 was my second big punt. I didn't realize they had an onboard {{Karakas}}
tucked in with their other lands! Made a Pile that would have lost to
{{Endurance}} when I could easily have put them on 0 outs with an {{Ideas
Unbound}} that drew in to {{Pact of Negation}}.

<row variant="centered">{{!StP}}</row>

#### Round 7 vs Mark Kelley on {U}{W}{G} Control. Win (2-1)

G1 Not much to say here.

G2 I tried to resolve {{Doomsday}} on turn 1 with plenty of backup but they
played {{Flusterstorm}}. Given how big a blowout that play was, the game was
actually rather close. Think I put 3 copies of {{Doomsday}} on the stack total.

Game 3 was another regrettable situation involving {{Karakas}} but this time
they played it from hand. However I only had the {{Doomsday}} in my yard and
went to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}} with one card in library to win through
{{Endurance}}. Pretty sure that they could have hardcast that {{Endurance}}
earlier to kill me...

#### Round 8 vs Stephen Dupal on Elves. Win (2-0)

G1 They played heath go. I didn't know exactly what they were on but resolved
turn 1 {{Doomsday}} with {{Undeground Sea}} and a fetch in hand. Made the
following pile to beat {{Wasteland}} + {{Thalia, Guardian of Thraben}} over two
turns.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!Volcanic Island|LEB}}</row>

They knew they couldn't win and so just chose to not reveal what deck they were
on. I assumed {G}{W} depths.

G2 they {{Thoughtseize}} twice, and made in my mind a poor choice to take {{Dark
Ritual}} over a {{Preordain}} in a situation where my only other draw spells
were cyclers. The {{Preordain}} let me dig to a {{Brainstorm}} that ended the
game.

<row variant="centered">{{!Nettle Sentinel|EVE}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Matthew Czuzak on Madness. Win (2-1)

G1 lost after playing around a topdecked {{Burning Inquiry}}, they discarded
{{Anger}}, {{Vengvine}} and played two Hollow Ones to kill from 10 life.

G2 I kept a super interactive hand where I was able to {{Daze}}, Force the
enablers. I then drew some cantrips while they were stuck doing nothing and won
easily.

G3 Went to 5 for a hand of {{Ponder}}, {{Force of Negation}}, land, {{Dark
Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}. They kept a hand reliant on a turn one {{Faithless
Looting}} that I Forced. Draw land for turn and resolved {{Doomsday}} for an
easy turn 2 win.

*Note: MtGMelee has a mistake and the {{Vapor Snag}} should be a {{Chain of

#### Round 1 vs Kyle Dorgan on Karnforge. Win (2-1)

Nothing to note here. Typical combo matchup for DD where I bought time with
counterspells to get a same turn win with Doomsday.

#### Round 2 vs Austin Blackner on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-1)

Lost G1 due to Delver doing Delver things.

Games 2 and 3 he kept hands high on interaction but no threat which weren’t
difficult to beat.

#### Round 3 vs Maximilian Sagraves on {U}{R} Delver. Win (2-0)

G1 had a quick {{Doomsday}} through {{Force of Will}}+{{Daze}} with {{Duress}} +
{{Force of Will}} backup and made a ptt (pass-the-=turn) pile that passed twice
and played around most things except something like triple {{Lightning Bolt}} or
threat + double bolt.

G2 he just kept a hand with {{Daze}} and no threat. Something of note in that G2
that happens in paper play that you don’t get online is after I Doomsday’ed
through his {{Daze}} he sort of slumped in his chair which I read as he didn’t
have anything else to fight back so I went for the same turn kill in lieu of a
ptt pile. It ended up being the case that he didn’t have anything but that could
have been a nutty bluff too.

<row variant="centered">{{!Delver of Secrets}}</row>

#### Round 4 vs Michael Morris on {R}{W} Painter. Win (2-0)

Both games I had some really good hands that went off quick with protection. G1
he plays {{Ancient Den}} then passes which I read as not a Force deck so I just
jammed.

G2 had counters for anything that mattered and jammed a pile that wins on the
same turn.

Outside the game note: this round had a random deck check for our table where I
got pulled aside for my list being different than the deck I was presenting. Mtg
Melee was struggling for ~36 hours up to the event including right up to the
event start so I was confident there was an issue with the site and me manually
inputting my deck. I had triple-checked the list prior to driving out to the
event and it matched up with what was in my deck so I’m not sure where/when the
mixup happened. I was able to defend my position to the judges while also being
respectful of their position and fortunately didn’t get a game loss.

#### Round 5 vs Tyler Carden on ANT. Win (2-0)

Again, typical combo vs Doomsday matchup. It was interesting and fun playing
discard battles again though because you don’t get to play
{{Thoughtseize}}/{{Duress}} mirrors in current legacy as much.

#### Round 6 vs Dennis Hillyer on {U}{W}{G}{R} Control. Loss (1-2)

G1 was a T2 or T3 {{Doomsday}} with backup. He had {{Endurance}} but {{Force of
Will}}+{{Pact of Negation}} was enough.

G2 I never saw a 2nd land after cantripping, Pondering twice and Brainstorming
so I was stuck on {{Volcanic Island}} the whole game and fell way behind. I was
finally able to {{Doomsday}} and make a pile that could win if my opp
egregiously misplays more than once but I messed up the chances by not piling
Emrakul 2nd so I could {{Shelldock Isle}}. First misbuilt pile of the day.

G3 was just a series of clunky draws that were enough to resolve a doomsday but
couldn’t beat the {{Pyroblast}} in his hand that hit my brainstorm and left the
Emrakul stranded in my hand while he beat down with his {{Collector Ouphe}}.

<row variant="centered">{{!Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath}}</row>

#### Round 7 vs Michael Horn on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (0-2)

This match felt like how the {U}{R} delver matchup should go. Had a ptt pile g1
that he triple bolted me out of.

G2 I had a turn that I think I could have won through but misplayed. After
cantripping + casting {{Ideas Unbound}} I had {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}},
{{Thoughtseize}}, {{Pact of Negation}}, {{Street Wraith}} and {{Pyroblast}}. I
{{Thoughtseize}} them and see Blast x2 and FoW x3. I took one of the Forces but
I think I should have taken one of the Blasts. I don’t remember how much mana I
had open or know if there is a same-turn winning pile post-Doomsday resolving
through 1x blast+3x force with that hand but I couldn’t have beaten 2x blast
with that hand anyway so I should have taken the blast. I was in a bad spot that
game anyway but I closed the door on myself.

On the whole with the {U}{R} delver matchup it seemed as though this opp knew
how to play against Doomsday whereas my previous 2 opponents didn’t have as many
reps against the deck. Keeping a hand that goes T1 Ponder and a bunch of
interaction but no early threat is a good way to lose a good matchup against
Doomsday which is what both of my previous delver opponents did.

#### Round 8 vs Anrew Arconti on Moon Stompy. Loss (0-2)

Got absolutely run over this match. It was one of those matches where stompy had
everything and can keep jamming threats+lock pieces to run you out of resources.
They had {{Jeska’s Will}} in the list though which I thought was cool.

<row variant="centered">{{!Blood Moon}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Landon Handerson on Elves. Win (2-1)

G1 I Doomsday’ed quick but punted hard but not putting {{Ideas Unbound}} in the
pile. (Pile punt count #2) That made me have to pass the turn 3 times against
Elves which is a death sentence even with a Force.

Games 2 and 3 I had T2 or T3 Doomsdays after some interaction or with
protection.

#### Closing Thoughts

Playing in a big paper tournament again was a blast and I hope to get in more
like it soon. This was easily the biggest tourney I’ve been in since the
pandemic started with the next closest being a 45 player modern $2k in August.
Everyone I interacted with just seemed stoked to be there. The pit staff were
also respectful in my experience. I’ve heard concerns from other players about
not enough precautions for a tournament this size during covid and the only
other precaution I could think to do would be follow what other
concerts/festivals are doing in requiring proof of vaccination or a negative
covid test within 72 hours at the door.

Concerning the deck, Doomsday felt like a great pick for the tourney. 9 rounds
of doomsday didn’t feel that crazy from a mentally taxing standpoint and I’d
100% choose playing this deck for the next big tournament. Getting the reps in
and memorizing the majority of common piles went a long way in consolidating
mental energy throughout the tournament. Only egregiously misbuilding 2 piles in
retrospect across 9 rounds of Magic could be worse but also can be improved upon
for sure. On the note of list changes, I don’t know how I feel about the
Emrakul + Shelldock plan anymore. Emrakul rotting in your hand is real bad, has
happened to me in multiple games, and Bant has been preparing for the Emrakul
plan now with {{Karakas}}, {{Dress Down}}, {{Back to Basics}}, etc. I’m going to
cut that package from the board and see how that goes next time. The maindeck
Island was also meh in it didn’t cast Doomsday and it didn’t protect me from
{{Wasteland}} that much anyway when the opp can just waste my Sea and I’m back
at no black mana. Now that {{Consider}} is legal too I’m looking forward to
trying {{Consider}} + {{Deep Analysis}} which brings me to my list changes.

Maindeck:

- Taking out the {{Island}} and replacing it with either a {{Watery Grave}} or
  the 9th fetch.
- Making room for some number of {{Consider}} + {{Deep Analysis}}. Probably
  going to start with cutting {{Preordain}} + trimming some cyclers and see
  where that goes.

Sideboard:

- Cutting {{Nausea}}. Against elves I didn’t seem to need it and I have
  {{Massacre}} against DnT.
- Cutting the Emrakul + Shelldock plan and going to try the double-Oracle plan

#### Round 1 vs Mark Marra on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Win (2-1)

Round 1 of the tournament began with me facing Mark Marra on Jeskai Tempo, with
me on the play. So, welcome back to Legacy – let’s start with a tough matchup
right out of the gates. I was able to take Game 1 largely due to casting an
end-step {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} that spurred an exchange where my opponent cast
{{Daze}} and {{Force of Will}}. I was lucky enough to find Doomsday off
{{Brainstorm}} the following turn and already had Dark Ritual in hand. That let
me build a pile that could win through {{Wasteland}} and the active Ragavan on
board while losing to {{Force of Will}} #2 + blue card (which I felt wasn’t
likely):

<row variant="pile">{{!SW}} {{!Volcanic Island|LEB}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}}</row>

In: {{Cavern of Souls}}, 2 {{Duress}}, {{Abrade}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}  
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

Game 2 was very close and involved a lot of decision-making with cantrips trying
to find disruption, mana, and {{Doomsday}}. I ended up making a misplay at one
point with my cantrip decisions with Ragavan on the board, as I figured out
after the fact that I needed double {{Daze}} to win and lost one of my {{Daze}}s
to Ragavan.

Game 3, I got lucky on a mull to 4 that had a turn 1 {{Doomsday}} with {{Daze}}
backup. I decided to build a 2-turn pile that would lose to {{Wasteland}}.

<row variant="pile">{{!CoS}} {{!SW}} {{!EoA}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

I was able to fade Wasteland and got there.

#### Round 2 vs Patrick Humfleet on {G}{W} Depths. Win (2-0)

Again, I was on the play. Game 1 was fast – an opening {{Thoughtseize}} showed
me I was clear to go for a fast kill. By turn 2, I had 2 cyclers, {{Dark
Ritual}}, and {{Doomsday}} in hand with no mana floating after Doomsday. A pile
of LED, IU, {{Lotus Petal}}, {{Pact of Negation}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}} enabled
the same turn win with 2 cyclers in hand.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!PoN}} {{!TO}}</row>

In: {{Echoing Truth}}, 2 {{Abrade}}  
Out: 2 {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Preordain}}

Game 2, my opponent and I both mulled to 6, and my opponent came out with a plan
to just race me with a fast Marit Lage. This is one game where {{Lim-Dul’s
Vault}} found me a win where {{Personal Tutor}} wouldn’t. By Patrick’s third
end-step, he had assembled the combo. I cast {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} then, holding
{{Brainstorm}}, cycler, and {{Lotus Petal}}, and land in hand. After paying 10
life (so looking through practically my entire deck!) I was able to find a Vault
pile that would win the game for me in {{Stifle}}, {{Doomsday}}, cycler, {{Dark
Ritual}}, X. On my turn, I drew {{Stifle}} and passed to my end step, where I
cast {{Stifle}} on {{Thespian's Stage}} activation. In Patrick’s end step, I
cast {{Brainstorm}} and put cycler and land on top. On my turn, I drew the 2nd
cycler and won using the same pile as game 1.

<row variant="centered">{{!Dark Depths|CSP}}</row>

#### Round 3 vs Anthony Arevalo on {U}{W}{R} Sagavan. Loss (1-2)

Anthony is a regular at Dice City Games, the other store in the DC Metro Area
that has a highly competitive Legacy meta, and I recognized his playmat and
vaguely recognized him under his mask from monthly tournaments at DC Games.

Game 1 was quite strange, in that Anthony never fetched a red source, only
{{Tundra}}s, presumably to hide what he was on; we exchanged {{Stifle}}s on
fetches and {{Wasteland}}, and I eventually found the combo with disruption in
the form of {{Thoughtseize}} and {{Force of Will}} backup to win with a pass the
turn pile using {{Ideas Unbound}}.

In: {{Cavern of Souls}}, 2 {{Duress}}, {{Abrade}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}  
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

I remember Game 2 being a slog, with us again trading {{Stifle}}s on
fetches/{{Wasteland}}, my having to deal with an initial Ragavan with {{Abrade}}
out of the sideboard. This was followed up by Anthony with a second continuously
*dashed* Ragavan that I was unable to deal with. I made a critical mistake with
my cantrip decisions at this point that cost me the game, as I piled my
{{Ponder}}s incorrectly twice – the first, giving away a land I actually would
have needed, and the second giving up a {{Daze}} that I originally thought would
have had no impact, but after I saw Anthony using his Ragavan Treasures right
away and was tapping out each turn, meant having double {{Daze}} would likely
have won me the match. So, by the time I was able to cast {{Doomsday}} and win
the same turn, I was at 1 life, meaning I lost the game.

Game 3 was low impact from my side – I was able to disrupt with an early
{{Stifle}} into a follow-up {{Duress}} to buy time, but my cantrips simply kept
hitting more discard and air rather than finding me {{Doomsday}}. By the time I
was able to find {{Doomsday}}, Anthony had stabilized and started finding
{{Wasteland}}s and threats to quickly diminish my life total.

#### Round 4 vs Bryant Cook on TES. Loss (0-2)

Bryant was a friendly face in the tournament and one of the many players I was
hoping to be able to play with that I used to have great games with on MTGO. We
both knew what each other was playing; I was very familiar with Bryant’s entire
list, and I was pretty sure Bryant knew I was on Max’s {{Stifle}} version of
Doomsday from our chats before the tournament that day. I would like to have
said I played these games as well as I could, but that wouldn’t be true. The
problem with not having played much Magic at all for over a year is that you
start feeling fatigued earlier in a tournament than you would have if you were
keeping up playing. This was probably my worst played match of the day. As a
result, it’s also the match I remember the best, since I have thought about how
I could have played it better since then.

Game 1, I kept a slow hand of {{Ponder}}, 2x {{Force of Will}}, {{Street
Wraith}}, Fetchland, Fetchland, and was on the play. Against any other deck and
player, I would have said this would have been a fine keep. Against Bryant on
TES, I should have looked for a faster combo hand, since that is how
{{Doomsday}} wins the Storm matchup. I opened with fetching for an {{Underground
Sea}} and cast {{Ponder}} – I believe I shuffled that {{Ponder}} and drew
{{Lotus Petal}}. Bryant had a very fast start as expected and was able to play
out much of his mana as expected and cast {{Ponder}}. On my turn, I drew
{{Brainstorm}} and cast it to find another {{Brainstorm}}, a second {{Street
Wraith}}, and a land – no second blue card to hold up double FoW. I put {{Lotus
Petal}} and Land back on top and played out a second fetchland. Bryant cast
{{Wishclaw Talisman}} on his turn, which I attempted to counter with {{Force of
Will}} (pitching {{Brainstorm}}). He responded with {{Veil of Summer}}, which I
had expected to happen. I cracked the fetch to get a shuffle and felt good about
playing to my outs with two {{Street Wraith}}s in hand. With Veil on the stack,
I cycled the first {{Street Wraith}}, which drew another {{Street Wraith}}. I
then cycled the remaining two into cards that were not blue, and I lost the
match to natural Tendrils off the Wishclaw. One note is that if I had let
Wishclaw resolve, Bryant had enough mana on board to be able to kill me through
an {{Ad Nauseam}} line with ease, so the Wishclaw was a must counter with the
expectation that I would also have to counter a {{Veil of Summer}} in response.

In: 2 {{Duress}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}  
Out: 2 {{Pact of Negation}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

In Game 2, Bryant mulled to 6 while I mulled to 5 – {{Stifle}}, {{Force of
Will}}, {{Flusterstorm}}, {{Street Wraith}}, {{Underground Sea}}. Not ideal,
workable. Unfortunately, I played this game horribly. I started by cycling
{{Street Wraith}} to find a cantrip, but hit another land instead. I played out
the {{Underground Sea}} and passed. Bryant has a less explosive start with
fetch, pass. I draw {{Doomsday}}, play out my second land and pass for turn.
Bryant led his turn on {{Brainstorm}}, then played a Taiga (representing Veil in
my mind) then played out Petal, LED, and {{Mox Opal}} into {{Wishclaw
Talisman}}. At this point in game 2, I should have been playing more patiently,
but I decided to go with a high risk, high reward play that in retrospect was a
poor decision made out of a feeling of desperation from being on a mull to 5 – I
was going to make a bluff to try to steal Bryant’s Wishclaw from him by letting
it resolve (thus representing I didn’t {{Force of Will}} even when I did)
because he had two cards left in hand at that point by my counting. One would be
presumably {{Veil of Summer}}, and the other potentially {{Dark Ritual}}. So,
when Bryant cast {{Veil of Summer}}, I responded with {{Flusterstorm}} – perhaps
too quickly. I was surprised when he stopped right there, although after reading
his tournament report, I can see why he stopped now. Next turn, I drew a third
land, which was unexpected. I quickly played it, and I figured at that point,
that was my window to try to go for a win by casting {{Doomsday}} and building a
fastest-killing pass-the-turn pile I could (IU, Edge, Land, TO, X) while holding
up {{Force of Will}} on Bryant’s turn.

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!EoA}} {{!Underground Sea|LEB}} {{!TO}} {{!Island|RAV}}</row>

What I should have thought more carefully about was the possibility of Bryant
having {{Echo of Eons}} in hand, which he did and led on the following turn. Now
my problem was my pile, while drawn if I survived a turn would win me the match,
was not built to handle an Echo of Eons and could only counter one spell,
assuming I drew {{Force of Will}} in my fresh 7. I should have let it resolve
anyway, but I instead countered it, and that exact amount of life loss let
Bryant kill me with a natural Tendrils. It was a huge misplay, but I also played
that whole game incredibly poorly.

I talked with both Max and Romario after the match about Game 2 specifically,
and they had different takes. Max was of the opinion that I did have to go for a
{{Doomsday}} there because I was so far behind, but I should have jam packed my
pile with counter magic and that way let {{Echo of Eons}} resolve to keep Bryant
off the win. Romario was of the opposite opinion, that I should have waited,
since I had the ability to {{Force of Will}} or {{Stifle}} and could potentially
draw into a same turn kill. After the match, Bryant and I also talked a little
about game 2, and he shared Max’s opinion that I should have let {{Echo of
Eons}} resolve and counter the payoff spells post-Echo. It’s a tough choice,
either way, but I think in the end that Romario was right and I should have
waited to cast Doomsday.

<row variant="centered">{{!Wishclaw Talisman}}</row>

#### Round 5 vs Kyle Souza on {U}{R} Delver. Loss (1-2)

I was on the draw and kept a slow 6, not knowing what Kyle was on. I can’t
recall exactly what my hand was Game 1, other than I had {{Force of Will}},
land, and multiple cantrips. I opened with fetch for {{Underground Sea}},
{{Ponder}}, which I shuffled, and passed. I recall Kyle opening on a DRC. On the
following turns, I spun my wheels while getting Wastelanded out of the game. By
the time I recovered, Kyle had Delerium turned on with DRC, eventually flipped a
Delver, and was able to close the game out with a series of burn spells.

In: {{Cavern of Souls}},  2 {{Duress}}, {{Abrade}}, 2 {{Flusterstorm}}  
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

Game 2, I kept a really fast 7 that consisted of {{Volcanic Island}}, Fetch,
Fetch, {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Stifle}}, {{Daze}}. I couldn’t ask for a
better 7 against Delver. Kyle mulled to 6. I went turn 1 playing my fetchland
and passed. On Kyle’s turn, I cast {{Stifle}} on his fetchland. On my turn, I
drew another {{Daze}}. I played the other fetchland, cracked it for
{{Underground Sea}}, cast {{Dark Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}}, and passed with my
pile being {{Ideas Unbound}}, {{Edge of Autumn}}, {{Lotus Petal}}, {{Thassa’s
Oracle}}, {{Cavern of Souls}}.

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!EoA}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}} {{!CoS}}</row>

Kyle untapped, played another fetchland, cast {{Ponder}}, and passed. I cast
{{Ideas Unbound}}, played {{Lotus Petal}}, cycled into Cavern on Merfolk, and
cast an uncounterable {{Thassa’s Oracle}} for the win.

Game 3, I was on a mull to 5, but found a quick hand of Fetchland, {{Dark
Ritual}}, {{Doomsday}}, {{Daze}}.  
I drew into a second {{Daze}} after Kyle opened with {{Volcanic Island}} into
{{Delver of Secrets}}. On my turn, I cracked the fetch for {{Underground Sea}},
cast {{Dark Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}}. I built a pile to beat {{Wasteland}} but
would require fading 2 turns to so: Fetchland, Edge, TO, Cavern, {{Volcanic
Island}}.

<row variant="pile">{{!Polluted Delta|ONS}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}} {{!CoS}} {{!Volcanic Island|LEB}}</row>

Unfortunately, that didn’t matter – Kyle revealed {{Brainstorm}} to flip Delver,
played {{Volcanic Island}}
#2, then attacked with Delver. He cast {{Lightning Bolt}}, which I Dazed and he Dazed back, then he cast
{{Lightning Bolt}} #2 for the win.

#### Round 6 vs Michael Fajardo Evangelista on Elves. Win (2-0)

I lost the die roll and saw an opener of Yavimaya into {{Quirion Ranger}}. Elves
is generally a favorable matchup assuming I can race game 1, which I could. I
had mulled to a 6 that had land, land, {{Dark Ritual}}, cantrip, LDV, {{Daze}} I
drew into {{Ponder}}, and cast it turn 1, finding {{Doomsday}}. The following
turn, Michael cast {{Nettle Sentinel}} and another {{Quirion Ranger}}. I
untapped, drew into a blank, played a land and cast {{Doomsday}}. I made a
cycler pile into {{Thassa’s Oracle}}. Next turn, Michael tried to find a way to
go off by leading on {{Elvish Visionary}}, which I Dazed to win game 1 when I
untapped.

In: 2 {{Flusterstorm}}, 2 {{Duress}}  
Out: 4 {{Daze}}

Game 2, I kept a 6 that I think was {{Flusterstorm}}, {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Dark
Ritual}}, {{Underground Sea}}, fetchland, and {{Doomsday}}. I remember Michael
also mulling to 6 and leading on {{Thoughtseize}}. The following turn, I
Thoughtseized back, seeing he had a slow hand. I took his {{Elvish Visionary}}
and passed. On his turn, Michael played out some of the 1-drop creatures from
his hand and passed. On my turn, I cast {{Brainstorm}} and drew into
{{Doomsday}}, {{Lotus Petal}}, and a {{Volcanic Island}}. I cast {{Dark Ritual}}
into {{Doomsday}} off the fetched {{Underground Sea}} and built the following
pile: {{Ideas Unbound}}, {{Stifle}} (for {{Endurance}} off {{Allosaurus
Shepherd}}), {{Lotus Petal}}, {{Edge of Autumn}}, {{Thassa’s Oracle}}. I ended
up not needing the {{Stifle}}, since my opponent couldn’t find a {{Glimpse of
Nature}} or {{Natural Order}}.

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!Stifle}} {{!LP}} {{!EoA}} {{!TO}}</row>

#### Round 7 vs Zach Felix on Elves. Win (2-1)

Game 1 went in my favor rather quickly, despite being on the Draw. I kept a six
that had {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Daze}}, {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}, {{Underground Sea}},
Fetch, {{Ponder}}. Zach opened with {{Quirion Ranger}} turn 1. Back to back
Elves felt like a boon after facing 3 Ragavan decks earlier in the tournament. I
played {{Underground Sea}} and cast {{Ponder}} to find a {{Force of Will}}.
Zach’s second turn involved playing a {{Quirion Ranger}} and {{Nettle
Sentinel}}. I played a fetch and passed. Zach didn’t draw any engine cards, so
he played a couple more creatures and swung for a few points of damage. In his
end step, I cast {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} and found {{Doomsday}} right away. When I
untapped, I cast {{Doomsday}} and made a cycler pile. The following turn, Zach
didn’t topdeck a win, so I was able to cast {{Thassa’s Oracle}} without issue
the following turn.

In: 2 {{Flusterstorm}}, 2 {{Duress}}  
Out: 4 {{Daze}}

Game 2 was much more interactive. Zach kept his 7, and I think I mulled to 6
again that had a turn 1 {{Dark Ritual}} into {{Doomsday}} with no backup, but
had cantrips. Zach opened on {{Thoughtseize}}, taking {{Doomsday}}, leaving me
to have to dig. Zach continued building his board turn 2 and ran his Grist into
a {{Daze}} while I found nothing off my {{Brainstorm}}, leaving me with blue
card and {{Street Wraith}} in hand. By turn 3, Zach got the Glimpse engine
online and drew into {{Craterhoof Behemoth}}, which cast that same turn. I
cracked my fetchland to clear the top of my library, then cycled with {{Street
Wraith}} playing to my outs for a {{Force of Will}}, which I did not draw.

Game 3, I kept a strong 7 that, with cantrips, got me to a turn 2 {{Doomsday}}
with {{Force of Will}} backup. At this point, my memory is a bit fuzzy, but I
think Zach mulled twice. It didn’t end up mattering, but I misbuilt my
{{Doomsday}} pile to be a pass-the-turn where I had one blue mana open. I likely
could have built a pile of {{Brainstorm}} (cycler in hand), LED, cycler, TO, X,
X. It would have left me open to {{Endurance}}, though, so I decided to go with
{{Ponder}}, {{Ideas Unbound}}, Land, Petal, TO to hold up {{Force of Will}} on
{{Endurance}} (which he didn’t have in hand) to win.

<row variant="pile">{{!Pnd}} {{!IU}} {{!Underground Sea|LEB}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

#### Round 8 vs Juanmanuel Angulo on Ninjas. Win (2-1)

Game 1, we both kept 7’s. At this point in the tournament, I honestly couldn’t
recall what my 7 was, other than it had FoW, cantrips, {{Dark Ritual}}, and
land. My opponent opened to {{Underground Sea}}, {{Ponder}}, pass. So at first I
thought I was in a combo mirror. I cast a {{Ponder}} on my turn as well. My
opponent cast another cantrip and then played out {{Ornithopter}}. Ok, I’m
facing {{Ninjas}} - not a great matchup, actually kinda bad. On my turn, I find
the combo and set up a pass the turn pile with {{Ideas Unbound}}. My opponent
ninjitsus in Yuriko on his turn and hits me for a decent amount, but not enough
to keep me from winning the following turn.

In: {{Cavern of Souls}}, 2 {{Duress}}, {{Red Elemental Blast}}, {{Pyroblast}},
{{Flusterstorm}}  
Out: 4 {{Force of Will}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}

Game 2, I mulled to a quick 6, and my opponent also mulled to 6. He opened with
{{Thoughtseize}} taking {{Doomsday}}, then played out 2 {{Ornithopter}}s. My
cantrips were unable to find another {{Doomsday}} in the following turns,
meaning I quickly died to a board of ninjas.

Game 3, I kept a slower 7 that was full of disruption. My opponent mulled to 5.
I opened on {{Thoughtseize}}, taking his {{Force of Will}}. He played out his
two {{Ornithopter}}s and passed. On my turn, I cantripped to find {{Doomsday}}
and left mana open to {{Stifle}} ninjitsu, which I did the following turn. My
next draw was a {{Red Elemental Blast}}, which I used on Yuriko the next time it
entered the battlefield. When I untapped, I found the third land for Doomsday,
had Cavern in hand, and made a cycler pile that won me the match the following
turn.

<row variant="centered">{{!Changeling Outcast}}</row>

#### Round 9 vs Daniel McCaulley on Urza Echo ft. Painter Transformation. Loss (1-2)

Game 1 was weird - I kept a 7 that just needed me to find {{Dark Ritual}} and I
had {{Force of Will}} backup. My opponent started out fast into an Emry that
whiffed. The next turn, I find the ritual and immediately cast {{Doomsday}},
making a cycler pile to cast {{Thassa’s Oracle}} with {{Force of Will}} backup.
My opponent spins his wheels the following turn, not top decking well.

In: 2 {{Abrade}}, {{Red Elemental Blast}}, {{Pyroblast}}, {{Cavern of Souls}}, 2
{{Flusterstorm}}, 2 {{Duress}}, {{Echoing Truth}}  
Out: 2 {{Stifle}}, 2 {{Pact of Negation}}, 2 {{Lim-Dul’s Vault}}, 2 {{Street Wraith}}, 2 {{Lotus Petal}}

Game 2, we both mull to 6. My opponent opens with {{Painter’s servant}} naming
{W}, which is not what I want to see with a grip full of Red Blasts and
cantrips. On my turn, I draw {{Force of Will}} and play a fetch land. My
opponent casts {{Grindstone}} on his turn, which is met with {{Force of Will}}
from me. He forces back, I Red Blast his force, and he Forces again. The next
time he untaps, I lose.

Game 3, I mull to 5 looking for a quick {{Doomsday}}, which I don’t find.
Instead, I have {{Abrade}}, Petal, Fetch, Cantrip, {{Dark Ritual}}. I cantrip
turn 1 and shuffle to draw {{Street Wraith}}. My opponent plays turn 1 Painter.
Turn 2, I attempt to {{Abrade}} and am met with {{Force of Will}}. From there,
the game gets away from me as my opponent plays {{Urza’s Saga}} and finds
{{Grindstone}} off it over the next couple turns while I cantrip and find
nothing good.

#### Closing Thoughts

Playing Doomsday in paper felt just as easy as online to me, except I found
myself choosing piles quicker to not get accused of stalling or slow play; not
that I found cause to feel that way in this tournament. I do think, though, that
there were several instances where I would have made better decisions if those
same games had been played on MTGO because I would be able to talk myself
through those lines out loud - something one really can’t do in paper.

I would say the weirdest part of playing Doomsday in paper was using copies from
Weatherlight and having to explain the Oracle text was updated to sequence
resolution differently starting in 6th edition. I was asked the same thing about
{{Lim-Dul’s Vault}} and struggled to explain the changes, even though at this
point I knew how it is supposed to resolve from playing it on MTGO. I suggested
we call a judge to get the Oracle text, but my opponent declined and said he was
just curious.

Overall, I was happy to have gone 5-4 after playing almost no Magic at all since
October 2020, although it is clear to me I could have played better and may have
finished better if I had played sharper/tighter. I felt that the
Doomsday/Ragavan Tempo matchup is much closer than I had expected it to be,
though I do feel like I have Dan and Kyle to thank for quickly bringing me up to
speed on that matchup. I think that overall, the deck is still well-positioned
in this meta. It’s not quite as well-positioned as it was in the Oko meta, but I
would say it is still the top combo deck. The Legacy Pit meta showed Doomsday
coming out to a 54% win rate (thanks to Jesse Hatfield for analysis), which was
right in the same ballpark as the Ragavan decks. Also, after the tournament,
Alex Rubin posted that he saw {{Torpor Orb}} a lot out of his opponents’
sideboards, validating my choice to run {{Abrade}}, even if I dodged {{Torpor
Orb}} myself. So overall, I think my deck choice was solid, as were my sideboard
card choices.

After the tournament, I got some barbecue in Frederick with some of my NoVA and
RVA friends. The food was pretty good, and it felt a bit surreal that we were
able to go have dinner with friends after playing Magic all day. It was honestly
great getting to play Legacy in paper again and great to hang out with old
friends. The Legacy Pit put on a great tournament, and I felt safe with the mask
enforcement. I look forward to being able to do this in the future.

## One Last Consider'ation

And there we have it! A big thank-you to all our contributors who submitted
reports for this article. As I said there were 11 players for Doomsday overall
and it's great to see so many choosing it for such a big event.

One final thing to note is the Wiki has now been updated with instructions on
how to integrate {{Consider}} into your pile building. For those unaware
{{Consider}} is a new card which allows for a couple of things. First of all it
allows existing {{Brainstorm}} + Cycler + X piles or {U} + Cycler Piles + X
piles to now go down to 0 cards left in deck.

> {U} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!Consider}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back X then Consider
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Consider
1. Cast Consider, put X into the graveyard and draw TO
1. Cast TO with the remaining mana from LED with zero cards left in your library

This also allowss you to create very mana/card efficient piles with the help of
{{Deep Analysis}}. If you have {U} and either {{Consider}} or a cycler in hand
you can build the following:

> {U} + Consider

<row variant="pile">{{!DA}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Consider, surveil the DA and draw LED.
1. Cast LED, crack it for {U}{U}{U} and flashback DA to draw SW and LP
1. Cycle SW, draw the TO
1. Cast LP and cast TO with the LP and the final {U} from the LED with zero
   cards left in your library

For the cycler variant just remove the SW from the pile and put {{Consider}} on
the top.

We will of course try to update other content including default decklists and
relevant interactions when we have time/enough data to do so.

## Closing Thoughts

If you haven't yet, please feel free to watch / listen to the interview with
Romario that can be found linked at the top of the page. feel free to judge my
(Doishy's) first attempt at sound editing!
