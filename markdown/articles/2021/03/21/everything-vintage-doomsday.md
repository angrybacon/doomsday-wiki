## Maindeck Configuration and Why no Cavern of Souls

below:

::decklist{path=2021/03/21/meandeck.diem4x}

Many players come from legacy doomsday to play vintage doomsday, and many wonder
why the deck does not play :card[Cavern of Souls]. The reason is that after
building a pile, you generally will have a :card[Gush] or :card[Ancestral
Recall] on top. If the opponent has a counterspell, they aren't going to save it
for the Oracle; they have to aggressively go after your Recall or Gush simply
because the card draw spell will draw you into a counter for their counter in
addition to your Oracle. In my mind, there are only three flex slots in the
maindeck for Doomsday. In this build, we have elected to use :card[Mystical
Dispute], :card[Force of Negation], and :card[Portent].

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- CoS
:::

**Mystical Dispute / Force of Negation**: These slots are generally between
either :card[Treasure Cruise] + disruptive spell or two disruptive spells.
Standard cards in these slots are 3rd :card[Daze], 4th :card[Flusterstorm],
:card[Duress], or :card[Chain of Vapor]. With shops and mirrors so popular in
the meta, it's nice to have a fifth free counterspell on the draw, so that's why
we have chosen Force of Negation. We have Mystical Dispute over something like
another Flusterstorm because of things like :card[Leovold, Emissary of Trest],
:card[Hullbreacher], and :card[Lavinia, Azorius Renegade]. These cards can be
significant problems, and having an excellent one mana answer that can also
counter :card[Force of Will]s is very lovely.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Mystical Dispute
- Force of Negation
:::

**Portent**: This slot is mainly for extra cantrips. Often you will see
:card[Sleight of Hand], :card[Peek], or even :card[Cling to Dust]. :card[Ponder]
is restricted for a reason, and while this card can't crack piles, it's very
good at being good card selection or messing up your opponent's top 3 cards,
especially in something like the mirror.

## Sideboard Configuration and Sideboard Guide

*With Bart van Etten and Max Vervoort*

**:card[Steel Sabotage]**: it is only used for the shops matchup, but it's so
crucial in that matchup that you want four after sideboard. It's the most
effective way to get rid of :card[Sphere of Resistance] type cards without
investing too much mana.

**:card[Mindbreak Trap]**: it's good vs. decks that try to do a lot on the first
turn, like :card[Paradoxical Outcome], shops, or the mirror. At worst, it's a
pitch to force, which makes sure it's not entirely a dead card when you draw it
later in the game.

**:card[Duress]**: an overall decent card against all decks where you want to
play around counters and a card that sometimes is exactly what you need in your
doomsday pile, especially when you have a Mox Jet in your start, so you don't
need to tap a land to play it. A handy thing it can do is snag a Brain freeze
before you combo, so you don't die on the spot.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Steel Sabotage
- Mindbreak Trap
- Duress
:::

**:card[Fatal Push]**: you need an answer for cards like Lavinia,
:card[Deathrite Shaman], :card[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben], :card[Archon of
Emeria], Leovold, :card[Collector Ouphe], and other hatebears, and Push is just
the most efficient one in the game. It's also good against ravager shops because
it can give you enough time to beat the stax pieces.

**:card[Opposition Agent]**: agent is outstanding in the mirror as it is a win
the game if it's not answered, while it's still decent vs. all decks that play
tutors.

**:card[Leyline of the Void]**: you only board it in vs. dredge or other bazaar
decks, but it's just the most efficient card to play in your doomsday sideboard
for that matchup without dedicating too many spots for the matchup.

:::row{variant=CENTERED}
- Fatal Push
- Opposition Agent
- Leyline of the Void
:::

**:card[Tasigur, the Golden Fang]**: you want an additional win condition
against decks that can disrupt your combo well, like :card[Brain Freeze] or a
deck with many specific counters, like Flusterstorm and :card[Pyroblast]. You
also board Tasigur in when your opponent boards out their removal spells, like
how Jeskai boards out :card[Swords to Plowshares], and you want another card
that they have to counter, yet it can't be hit by Flusterstorm, Pyroblast, or
even Force of Negation. Because of this, it can sometimes steal games.

**:card[Island]**: having a second basic is another tool for shops to better
play around :card[Wasteland] and :card[Ghost Quarter].

For the following parts, instead of doing a bit about standard piles such as
Gush/Recall, :card[Black Lotus], Oracle, Fluster, Wraith/second Oracle, etc.,
I've decided to show different puzzles on beating more challenging hate pieces
and piles you can make to do that.

## Playing vs. Breach

*With discoverN*

You are against Breach, and the opponent was on the play with seven cards and
went :card[Misty Rainforest], :card[Mox Ruby], pass (5 cards remaining). You
mulliganned once, and your hand is :card[Doomsday], Street Wraith, Force of
Will, :card[Preordain], :card[Underground Sea], Tasigur, :card[Dark Ritual].
Notable play arounds are Pyroblast/Fluster/Brain Freeze. How do you want to play
this turn and the rest of the game?

Our hand is:

*DiscoverN's response*

> **Game plan:**
>
> In this hand, First, I want to play tasigur.  
> And after the opponent moves, I want to play doomsday.
>
> **Choices:**
>
> 1. Play Ritual Doomsday: too risky.  
>    If the opponent doesn't have Brain Freeze, the opponent very likely has a
>    lot of counters. So, turn one kill won't be possible. 1. Cycling Wraith to
>    find a fetch, another Wraith, or Gitaxian probe to make casting Tasigur
>    easier. Not bad.
> 1. Play Preordain: my choice.  
>    This choice has few flaws.  
>    Good things: it can keep Street Wraith. Wraith is a vital card to beating
>    Brain Freeze.

## Playing vs. BUG

*With SingPanMan*

You are at 16 life vs. BUG game three (assume Fatal Push is in your deck and
nothing is exiled, so you have your whole deck to put in your pile) and cast a
Doomsday with a Dark Ritual in hand and 3 Underground Seas in play. Your
opponent has Leovold, Collector Ouphe, 3 lands, and 3 cards in hand. You assume
their graveyard doesn't matter (i.e., :card[Snapcaster Mage]). What is your
pile? (thinking about playing around Fluster, Wasteland, possibly Daze, etc.)

*SingPanMan's response*

> Demonic Tutor, Time Walk, Oracle, Oracle, Island (double Trophy is an issue)
>
> 1. Pass turn 1. Play Ritual 1. Play Tutor, and get Time Walk 1. Play Walk 1.
>    In extra turn, play Oracle
>
> I think there are low odds of winning this match.  
> But you will have to go all-in.
>
> If the opponent plays two trophies (or plays wasteland and trophy), you need
> to search Island.  
> Let's pray that it won't happen.
>
> **Bad**
>
> - Can withstand only one turn (16 life to 8, their board has 5 power) - Lose
>   with one counter (Flusterstorm, Force, Mindbreak Trap, Spell Pierce) - Lose
>   with one removal (Decay, Trophy) - 33% to lose (we can't draw the island) -
>   I can't afford the resources (it's all Leo's fault)
>
> **Good**
>
> - The opponent might not have Daze (if the opponent has Daze, they will cast
>   it on Doomsday) - A single Wasteland can be played around

:::row{variant=PILE}

## Playing vs. Bant

*With discoverN*

Your Opponent casts Archon of Emeria with five cards in hand on the play in turn
two. It is game three (You have Fatal Push in your deck, and they may have cards
like :card[Meddling Mage] or :card[Deafening Silence]). You untap and cast
Doomsday off of two lands and a Mox after time walking (You drew Daze for turn
and Ritual last turn). You still have a land drop, and Doomsday resolves. You
are at 19 life. (Remember about Archon's tapped land condition and notable cards
to try to play around are things like Lavinia, Ouphe, Meddling Mage,
Hullbreacher, maybe Deafening Silence, counterspells like Flusterstorm, and even
:card[Spell Queller]). What is your pile, and what do are you trying to do in
the following turns?

*DiscoverN's response*

> Timewalk, Oracle, Oracle, Island, Island
>
> This turn play tapped fetchland, pass.  
> Next turn, play tapped fetchland, time walk.  
> Next turn, play Oracle, fetch in response to removal if needed, or fetch to
> play around Dazes.  
> If countered, following turn play oracle again and can still fetch Island if
> needed.
>
> You may think that you want to get a Fatal Push pile here, but that means you
> would likely need the fatal push to resolve to win. If you were to cack fetch
> (revolt for fatal push) with holding priority and cast Fatal Push on Archon
> and still holding priority with the fetchland on the stack gush so you know
> the cards you can draw, not only do you lose to a Hullbreacher but you loose
> to Lavinia as well. The pile discoverN describes makes it so you can beat all
> of these cards as well as Flusterstorm and Daze (two Oracles).

## Playing vs. Shops

*With Jacobisboss*

I've decided to do one final puzzle of a Doomsday pile to beat Golos shops.

You cast Doomsday off of three lands and two Moxes, as there is a :card[Thorn of
Amethyst] and a Sphere of Resistance on the battlefield under your opponent's
control. They also control a :card[Phyrexian Revoker] with Black Lotus named, a
2/2 :card[Stonecoil Serpent] and an :card[Ancient Tomb], a :card[Mox Emerald],
an :card[Inventor's Fair], and two cards in hand. You are at 16 life, so after
Doomsday, you will be dead to 2 swings. Your hand consists of Preordain, Daze,
and Force of Will. What is the easiest way of winning the next turn playing
around Wasteland, another Sphere, Mindbreak trap, possibly Chalice, :card[Null
Rod], more Revokers, etc?

Our hand is:

:::row{variant=hand}
- Pre
- Daze
- FoW
:::

*My response*

> From the top: Steel Sabotage, Gush, Oracle, Lotus, Island  
> Goal: try to win in two turns.  
> The plan is to pass after the opponent attacks you to 4. You bounce the
> Revoker mid-combat with Steel Sabotage, and when they re-cast it, you Force of
> Will it. Then you untap and cast Gush, play land, and cast Black Lotus and
> Thassa's Oracle with Daze backup. There are ways to win the turn after you
> cast Doomsday, but all of them lose to a singular Sphere, a Mindbreak Trap, a
> Wasteland, all these things. This line also beats Wasteland, and if they play
> a Sphere instead of Revoker again, you can Force that too. The Island in the
> pile is important because then you can beat a Ghost Quarter as well.
>
> Another option:  
> From the top: Time Walk, Street Wraith, Thassa's Oracle, Island, Island  
> Goal: win next turn. The plan is to cast Time Walk and then cycle Street
> Wraith into Oracle and cast it with two cards in deck. This pile beats
> Mindbreak Trap, one Wasteland, one Sphere, Null Rod. The main issue with this
> pile is you are dead if they play a Revoker or a Spyglass and name street
> wraith.
>
> Both piles are justifiable, and honestly, there are another ten piles you
> could argue for as well. Playing vs. shops can be complicated, and the most
> essential thing is mana sources and having enough lands at all times.
