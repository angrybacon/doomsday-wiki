title: A pretty mean deck or; "What is this new meme everyone is playing?"
---

Hi everyone, 
it's safe to say, (especially looking at the article history from me),
it's been a while. So it seems after the dust settled from Breach (RiP),
people started realising there were other things a certain group of shadowy
(if somewhat eccentric) figures were doing in the dark corners of the internet. 
The only true signs of this cabal even existing was the occasional voyage of
of their emmissary (Monkeyscantcry) preaching to the weekly 5-0 deck dump
(five of course being a very sacred number). 

Since Breach went however the deck has suddenly got a lot of attention which
is both great and terrible at the same time. Great people are enjoying the 
archetype and it seems to be putting up enough results to show itself to be greater
than tier 10 however terrible in that a lot of people are picking up the deck
with no idea on what to do with it. In an effort to help spread the memes of 
Doomsday stacks comprised of 4 x {{Temporal Mastery}} and 1 x {{Thassa's Oracle}} and
to prevent pay-walled content telling you how to play the deck I thought I would 
write this little introduction to everything and dust the cobwebs off myself too.

So first things first:

### "What the hell does Meandeck Doomsday Mean?"

Meandeck Doomsday (either in BUG, Esper or BUgw form) is essentially a combo control
deck. The namesake stems from Team Meandeck, the team name of the old Ohio based,
predominantly Vintage crew of Stephen Menendian, Kevin Cron, Paul Mastriano, 
Jacob Orlove, Doug Linn, and Lou Christopher. Now traditionally Doomsday was a
Legacy Storm deck winning with the iconic card {{Tendrils of Agony}} (hence the 
moniker of Doomsday Fetchland Tendrils or DDFT for short) however Menendian brewed
up a list he had dubbed "Meandeck Doomsday" which was a more controlling shell 
focussing on winning via the card {{Laboratory Maniac}}. 

This deck didn't feature any of the titular storm cards such as {{Lion's Eye Diamond}} but
did instead pack a whole heap of counter magic featuring {{Force of Will}}, {{Spell Pierce}} and
{{Pact of Negation}} to name a few (even a {{Misdirection}}!). 

You can find a video of the deck in action [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuswAK0IYdg)

Now it was generally agreed by most of the Doomsday community at the time (2012) that the 
deck wasn't very good. Although it had cards such as {{Sensei's Divining Top}} 
and {{Gitaxian Probe}} (also RiP), it was often too slow and featured no raw card 
advantage engine to help circumnavigate the pitch counters it ran.
In addition the "normal" kill required use of a creature that died to every removal 
card in the format as well as needing to use the graveyard which opens you up to a lot
more disruption both pre and post sideboarding. As such the deck became something that 
newer players always asked about but never had any results. Through the discussions the
term "Meandeck Doomsday" became synonamous with "Doomsday featuring Force of Wills".


### From 2012 to 2020

Fast forwarding eight years and suddenly everyone and their mother are trying the deck out.
So what changed?

Why is a deck that has long been considered a joke suddenly become something that has put
out more Doomsday results the past two months than have been featured for the two years prior?

The very short answer is of course everyone's favourite fishy friend; {{Thassa's Oracle}}.

<pile>{{!TO}}{{!LM}}</pile>

Oracle has two key advantages that make it superior to {{Laboratory Maniac}}. The first is 
the mana cost. It may not seem like much going from {{2U}} to {{UU}} however when considering
the resource constraints you normally face with the deck such as {{Daze}}, {{Wasteland}} or
{{Thalia, Guardian of Thraben}} having a spare {{U}} can mean a lot. 

The second key advantage
is being able to win the game without having to draw a card in the process. Laboratory Maniac
has a window of opportunity whereby your opponent gets a change to kill it. If this suceeds you
more often than not just kill yourself with your otherwise game winning draw. Oracle however 
lets you win the game whether the card is in play or not. The Oracle text on Oracle states 
*'If X is greater than or equal to the number of cards in your library, you win the game.'* 
This means that even if the face of a {{Lightning Bolt}} you can still win if the trigger
resolves assuming you have 0 cards left in your library. 

So what does this actually mean?

First of all it means that you don't always have to rely on LED to generate enough mana 
for your Doomsday pile. Take this example from our [Basics Chapter](https://ddft.wiki/meandeck/basics/)

<pile>{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</pile>

If you play this turn with Force of Will and a blue card up, you can hold both to protect 
the win thanks to never having to need to discard your hand. Sounds pretty good right however
I bet you are thinking: "But who would play a card like {{Ideas Unbound}}. seems pretty bad?"
This thought process brings us to the next key part of the puzzle. Thanks to Oracle, we can 
play other draw spells to dig deep into our pile including ones that only need to grant us 
an additional two cards. 

{{Predict}} is a great example. This card has been played in Miracle decks to success and offers
a decent card advantage engine, especially given the high cantrip density the deck runs, even
outside of the combo. It can then be used as a combo piece either simply as a draw two that digs
three cards deep or can be used to synergise with {{Unearth}} allowing the playing of Oracle for 
the cost of a single {{B}}. 

<pile>{{!Pd}} {{!Pn}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>


<pile>{{!Pd}} {{!TO}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!Un}}</pile>

As you can see these piles are quite lean in terms of mana and card resource post Doomsday 
resolution. This, coupled with the fact you now have the counter magic along with old
faithfuls such as {{Thoughtseize}} and new faces such as  {{Veil of Summer}} means you 
suddenly have a quite convincing control list that can win out of nowhere. The number of 
"bad cards", whilst not being zero, has now dropped to maybe two-three per list and 
the range of splash colours on offer means the list is quite configurable to taste. 

### "You've shown me some piles, but how do they actually work!?"

One of the most common questions people have is based around "what are the most basic
piles?" or "where can I find a list of piles to learn." You shouldn't really try and 
rote learn piles but instead learn to work out what resources you have available
to them alongside some simple rules in terms of basic pile building. 

In the interest of helping newer folks however I will walk through some simple examples.

**Let us consider at the following scenario:

You have {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Ponder}} and {{Doomsday}} in hand and {{Island}}, {{Swamp}},
and 3 x {{Underground Sea}} in play.

Tap you lands for {{UUUUB}}.  
Use {{B}} to cast {{Dark Ritual}} adding {{BBB}} to pool.  
Use the {{{BBB}} to cast {{Doomsday}} with {{UUUU}} in pool.

Stack the following:

<pile>{{!Pd}} {{!Pn}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>

Use {{U}} to cast {{Ponder}}. Draw {{Predict}}.  
Use {{UU}} to cast {{Predict}} targeting yourself.  
Name {{Ponder}} with {{Predict}} putting {{Ponder}} into your graveyard and drawing
{{Street Wraith}} and {{Lotus Petal}}.  
Cycle the {{Street Wraith}} paying two life. Draw {{Thassa's Oracle}}.  
Cast {{Lotus Petal}}. Crack for {{U}} leaving {{UU}} in pool.  
Use {{UU}} to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}}.  

The entire line costs {{BBB}}+{{1UUU}} and requires a cantrip in hand.  
This is a very basic single cantrip pile.

**The second scenario to consider:

You have {{Doomsday}}, {{Street Wraith}}, {{Preordain}} in hand and
{{Swamp}} and 3 x {{Underground Sea}} in play.

Tap your lands for {{UBBB}}.  
Use {{BBB}} to cast {{Doomsday}} with {{U}} in pool.

Stack the following:

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!Pd}} {{!Pn}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>

Use {{U}} to cast {{Preordain}}. Draw {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}. 
Cast {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}.  
Cycle the {{Street Wraith}} paying two life. Hold priotity and crack 
{{Lion's Eye Diamond}} for {{UUU}}. Draw {{Predict}}.  
Use {{UU}} to cast {{Predict}} targeting yourself.  
Name {{Ponder}} with {{Predict}} putting {{Ponder}} into your graveyard and drawing
{{Thassa's Oracle}} and {{Lotus Petal}}.  
Cast {{Lotus Petal}}. Crack for {{U}} leaving {{UU}} in pool.  
Use {{UU}} to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}}.  

The entire line costs {{BBB}}+{{U}} and requires two cantrips in hand.  
This is a very basic double cantrip pile.

**The final scenario to consider:

You have {{Dark Ritual}}, {{Force of Will}}, {{Brainstorm}} and
{{Doomsday}} in hand and {{Island}}, {{Swamp}} in play.

Tap you lands for {{UB}}.  
Use {{B}} to cast {{Dark Ritual}} adding {{BBB}} to pool.  
Use the {{{BBB}} to cast {{Doomsday}} with {{U}} in pool.

Stack the following:

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pd}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>

Use {{U}} to cast {{Brainstorm}}. Draw {{Lion's Eye Diamond}},
{{Street Wraith}} and {{Predict}} and replace back first 
{{Force of Will}} and then {{Predict}} on top.  
Cast {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}.  
Cycle the {{Street Wraith}} paying two life. Hold priotity and crack 
{{Lion's Eye Diamond}} for {{UUU}}. Draw {{Predict}}.  
Use {{UU}} to cast {{Predict}} targeting yourself.  
Name {{Force of Will}} with {{Predict}} putting {{Force of Will}} into your graveyard and drawing
{{Thassa's Oracle}} and {{Lotus Petal}}.   
Cast {{Lotus Petal}}. Crack for {{U}} leaving {{UU}} in pool.  
Use {{UU}} to cast {{Thassa's Oracle}}.

The entire line costs {{BBB}}+{{U}} and requires {{Brainstorm}} and 
one additional card in hand.  
This is a very basic Brainstorm pile.

Feel free to have a go at goldfishing similar lines!

### "Okay, I'm interested! What list should I try?"

Currently there seem to be two main styles of play; Esper {{UBW}} and BUG {{BUG}}. 

BUG was the first iteration and the main offer is main deck {{Veil of Summer}} along with 
sideboard options like {{Abrupt Decay}} for problem permanents or cards like {{Xantid Swarm}}
and {{Carpet of Flowers}}. Normally the BUG lists run the meme-turned-viable plan B card
of {{Divining Witch}} as a way to never actually need to cast Doomsday in the first place. 

Esper changes your options slightly. Instead of Veil you have {{Teferi, Time Raveler}} to play
both the anti-hate and anti-counter role. It also lets you take a leaf from the recently
banned Breach decks and run a plan B of beating face with {{Monastery Mentor}} which has 
always been a hobby of mine.

There is still no clearly defined list that is "objectively better" however as the deck
garners interest, more and more minds will likely get it to a place where it will be 
at least a little more optimised than before. If you want some starting points for either
list TCDecks has some listed:

[Esper by Hulahula](https://www.tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=33721&iddeck=299988)

[BUG by Gre3n1T](https://www.tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=33454&iddeck=296642)

### "The Madness has taken me, how do I find out more!?"

If this seems to be your jam then look no further. The Doomsday wiki is designed to be the 
primary resource on any variants of the deck. The lack of contemperaneous content is 
due to a lot of format and deck change in a small amount of time and not a lot of willing
authors to write things! As this is a community run project we are always welcoming of new
submissions whether it is articles, puzzles or chapter pages. 

If you want even more content please check out our [Resources](https://ddft.wiki/resources/) page
which includes links to local streams or if you are up for a challenge maybe check 
out the [Puzzles](https://ddft.wiki/puzzles/) page.

Until next time.

May your world always be ending!
