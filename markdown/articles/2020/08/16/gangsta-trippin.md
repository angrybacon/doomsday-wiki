title: Gangster Trippin' - Cantrip discipline in Doomsday (and Legacy in general)
---

Everyone who has forayed into Legacy will know that the blue
*xerox* shell is very prevalent within the format. The shell
follows the school of thought that uses cheap, draw a card, effects
(colloquial known as cantrips) to enable sculpting of your hand
and finding answers when needed. There have already been a number
of articles that explore these theories by well known personalities
such as Reid Duke, AJ Sacher and Tomas Mar.

respectively.*

It was these articles and a questions from Doomsday Discord members 'Wally'
and 'Dale Cooper' that led to the inspiration to author this. Referring
back to the concept of the *xerox* shell, Doomsday is a prime example of this
in terms of deck construction. In fact, Meandeck Doomsday potentially boasts
the highest number of cantrips of any given archetype in Legacy running up to
a total of 18 replacement card draw effects within the main deck alone. 

In this article we hope to present the following points:

 - A summary of the cantrips and their purpose
 - The general principles of cantrip sequencing
 - Doomsday specific principles of cantrip sequencing
 - Discussion of example scenarios

## A summary of the cantrips involved

### Legacy Staples

The first suite of cantrips are what would be considered the *standard*
Legacy setup. Ponder and Brainstorm can be found of as 4-ofs in most
{U} based decks and Preordain as a 2-4 of in many as well.

#### {{Ponder}}

Ponder is powerful tool that allows you to 'see' 4 cards during
resolution. It is at its most powerful when paired with a fetchland
as this gives you the option to take the 'best' card of the first
three observed and shuffle away any potential unwanted pieces with 
the fetchland. Ponder is best suited for trying to find one specific
card which, for our intents and purposes, is normally Doomsday.

#### {{Preordain}}

Preordain is normally considered the 'weakest' of the classic suite.
Previously it has normally been relegated to combo decks who just
wanted additional filtering to find key pieces but is generally considered
weaker than Ponder as it sees 1 fewer cards. This point is in direct
contradiction to the wording presented in Reid's article.

> Preordain is ideal for digging to particular cards. This is why you
> see Preordain often in combo decks, but less often in fair decks like 
> Delver or Snow. Like Brainstorm, Preordain gets more powerful as the 
> game goes deeper, since you’ll have a clearer picture of what cards
> you’re looking for. 

I think the intent of the words is the same but the way they are presented
implies the opposite of the truth.

#### {{Brainstorm}}

Brainstorm has been described as a ['Pillar of the Format'](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/status/985674571188588544)
and is considered one of the most powerful spell effects in Legacy.
It acts as a way to 'see' 3 cards but can, in effect, give the ability
to exchange up to 2 cards from your hand, normally those considered
uneeded at the time, and get rid of them, again normally with the aid
of a fetchland. This in a sense can be viewed as almost drawing 3 cards
with some people comparing it to {{Ancestral Recall}}. 

### Free 'Cycling Effects'

This next pair are mostly unique to Doomsday however {{Death's Shadow}}
based decks will also make use of one of them. These are 'free' cycling 
cards that have little to no relevant text outside of their cycling
abilities (other than some specific circumstances). Their use is almost
always to provide a {0} mana draw effect after Doomsday has resolved.

#### {{Street Wraith}}

Street Wraith is used by Shadow decks to both thin out their draws
and to reduce their life total aggressively. For Doomsday it is
a  way to enable a lot of the piles made with the added benefit of
being a draw effect that is immune to normal countermagic. The
main downside of Street Wraith is the fact that, post Doomsday, 
your life total can be taxed quite heavily so having to rely on paying
2 or 4 life can be pretty punishing. Unlike Edge of Autumn however
it can be used even if you have played an aggressive hand via
Lotus Petals or if you need to retain a land to return with Daze
for example.

In some circumstances, it can be used as an additional win condition.
Casting a Street Wraith after your Doomsdays have been hit with a
{{Surgical Extraction}} effects or your opponent has paid 16 life
with {{Sylvan Library}} can be a legitimate way to win the game.
Against {B}{R} Reanimator there is also the potential to cycle it in
response to an {{Exhume}} whereby, thanks to the life paid to a
{{Griselbrand}} and the Swampwalk it can often present a lethal clock
out of nowhere.

For an excellent example of Street Wraith as a win condition please
watch [This Video](https://youtu.be/Eyi_R7QZiAc?t=2673) by Nevilshute
against {U}{B} Shadow.

#### {{Edge of Autumn}}

Edge of Autumn provides a method of cycling that is less taxing
on the manabase however can be of much less use outside of the
combo. Sacrificing a land can be a heavy costs however sometimes
it does mean you can mitigate the downside of a {{Wasteland}}
effect or similar by cycling in response. In a pinch you can also
use it to retrieve the third {B} source in the form of the basic
Swamp from the deck but the situations this is needed are far
and few between.

The thought process behind it mirrors that of the discard suite
utilised. Edge is effectively the equivalent of {{Duress}}. 
Although Duress is generally more narrow than {{Thoughtseize}}
in effect, the life loss can be significant so a mix is run
to provide maximum flexibility.

### Pile Enablers

The next pair are not cantrips in the traditional sense as they are more 
designed to provide raw card advantage in their use. Just like with the 
cycling cards, they tend to be considered primarily for their use within
Doomsday piles however they can have usage outside of this to varying
degrees. One is a well know staple for certain builds of Miracles and the 
other is a historical card from pre- {{Sensei's Divining Top}} ban DDFT
days. 

### {{Predict}}

Predict pairs effectively with other cantrips as you can use it to provide
additional filtering and raw card advantage. It also enables access to
Doomsday piles where you only have a single {U} available to dig into the pile
with. You can make use of effects like the reveal triggers on {{Delver of Secrets}}
or {{Counterbalance}} to gain advantage from your opponent's deck and,
in the mirror, it can even disrupt opposing Doomsday piles either milling
a key component or causing the pilot to inadvertently draw themselves to
death.

### {{Ideas Unbound}}

Ideas Unbound is a more effective card (resources allowing) during pile
construction but a weaker card outside of the combo. It can be used as
a large scale {{Faithless Looting}} effect to turn a land heavy hand
into a speall heavy hand. or provide an explosive boost of cards for 
a single turn, potentially enabling you to combo off there and then.

## Cantrip sequencing - General Principles

Normally, when playing a 'fair' Legacy deck, you need to filter through
your deck in order to find the balance of threats, protection and 
disruption depending on the situation. In a combo deck, this is normally
a bit more hyper-focussed to find the piece/pieces in order to 'go off'
as quickly as possible. More often in combo decks you will find yourself
shuffling off of Ponders or 'bottoming 2' off Preordains in order to
find what is needed. The following guidelines are only that, general 
guidelines. As with anything in life there are always possible exceptions
or circumstances where an alternative set of ideas are more valid than
those presented here so they should not taken as gospel truth.

In general, with your cantrips, you want to try and maximise the amount of
cards you 'see'. This gives you the most information to help you make the
most informed decision you can in your gameplay actions. If presented with 
a turn one hand with a single Island, and presented with a choice of leading
with a Ponder or Preordain generally it would be better to lead on the latter. 
This is because the Preordain will let you see up to 3 cards initially and, if
a fetchland is found in those 3 and / or the card drawn for your subsequent
turn, it will improve the Ponder used. 

If you have both and 2 non-fetchlands to cast them with then it is once again
better to lead with Preordain. This allows you to see up to 7 cards between the
2 of them. If you have 1 fetchland and 1 non-fetchland then it is better to lead
on the Ponder, fetch, then (if desired) play the Preordain. You may not wish to
retain all the cards seen from Ponder on the top of your deck and so want the
option to shuffle them away. You also don't wish to cast the Preordain to
potentially scry 2 cards to the bottom of your deck that are unwanted to then
shuffle them back to the top. This is also why it can be beneficial to crack any
fetches in play prior to casting Preordain.

You should always try and cast Brainstorm in conjucture with a fetchland. 
With this in mind it should rarely be cast on turn 1. The main times this
is acceptable are scenarios such as when trying to protect a card in hand from
opposing targeted discard or, if your hand is one (common) piece away from a 
deterministic win, and you think that you are able to find that piece through
an end-of-turn Brainstorm. Often though it is still worth not casting it so 
early in the game.

If you are trying to dig hard to find one particular card, perhaps in a
desperation scenario, it might be worth leaving a Brainstorm to be the 
last cantrip you play. This is because after resolving any Ponders and/or
Preordains you have, the Brainstorm cannot 'clear the top' of your library
so, although it can see 3 cards, it will not be able to have you view any
new ones in isolation. In non-desperation scenarioes it may be better to
Brainstorm and then use the scry 2 from Preordain or the shuffle from 
Ponder to act as a fetchland shuffle however this is generally inefficient
in terms of card usage.

## Cantrip sequencing - Doomsday Principles (pre-combo)

### Brainstorm Retention

In Doomsday there are a few considerations to make that can sometimes go
against what is considered *normal sequencing*. One example is the use
(or non-use) of Brainstorm. We know that Brainstorm, in conjecture with
an additional card in hand post-Doomsday resolving, can lead to a
deterministic, same-turn win. Let's consider the following hand:

<row variant="hand">{{!DR}} {{!Pn}} {{!FoW}} {{!FoW}} {{!S|RAV}} {{!Bs}} {{!Pre}}</row>

In this scenario we have 2 lands in play, Underground Sea and a Polluted Delta.

<row variant="hand">{{!Underground Sea}} {{!Polluted Delta}}</row>

It is turn 3.

Normally we would expect, in order to maximise the cards *seen* this turn, to 
lead with Brainstorm off of Underground Sea to then fetch away what we get rid of
and assume we will be casting Preordain next, maybe Ponder. One thing to consider
though, as we are looking for the Doomsday, is that if we find one, we can win
the game this turn with Brainstorm. As a result, what might be a better option
is to lead on Ponder. This gives us the maximum amount of cards seen for our 
mana and leaves us with the option to keep one card and shuffle away the rest. 

If we fail to find a Doomsday with the Ponder we have the option to fetch and use
the Preordain to try again. If our life total is not under pressure then we can play
Swamp and cast Dark Ritual and Doomsday this turn. If it is we can play Swamp and
pass the turn looking to hit the win on the next. Obviously the matchup and circumstance
plays a large role in what sequence or line to work towards but it does mean there 
are additional considerations to be made before playing an *optimal* Brainstorm.

### Cantrip Retention

Similar to the point above, quite often the scenario comes up whereby you have Doomsday
in hand plus the means to cast it but no way to *dig* into the pile. If the opponent
has pressure on board, this could mean you are unable to cast Doomsday until you find
some sort of cantrip. Sometimes this situation comes up from poor variance but other 
times it can be from a misuse of cantrips and an overly aggressive use of them to 
find the combo / mana pieces.

When working out what you need to win you of course need to note the relative pressure
you are under from your opponent. Do you need to cast a Ponder this turn or can it
wait until the next? One of the hardest lessons to learn in Legacy is probably when
it is fine to play a land and simply say "go". If you are playing against a {U}
based control deck, often they will not be able to place any pressure on the board 
until the later turns or if they do, it is often only something like an {{Ice-Fanged Coatl}}.
Being chipped away for 1 a turn is fine as it gives you a lot of time to work with
so don't feel like you have to use all your mana every turn. This same principle
applies to facing against {{Daze}} decks like Delver. It's okay to take a turn
or two and simply develop your mana without allowing them to trade 1:1 with your
cantrips.

### Cycling 

In terms of cantrip retention the best ones to keep back, when allowed, are the
free cycling cards; Wraith and Edge. They provide the most mana efficient method
to draw into a pile post-Doomsday resolving. As with everything however, this
may not always be the case and sometimes using a cycler prior to being in a position
to combo can be advantageous. 

If you have a dual land in play and an Edge of Autumn in hand and your opponent
activates Wasteland, targeting your dual, you can obtain value by cycling the 
Edge, sacrificing the dual land being targeted, to draw a card. If you
are only one card away from having the win, this might not be worth doing, especially
if you know the top cards of your library.

The cyclers can also be used 

Edge vs Wasteland  
SW casting?  
Cycle to improve a Brainstorm  
Cycle + LDV or PT

## Cantrip sequencing - Doomsday Principles (in piles)

Debate of Trip vs Trip vs Trip?

Doomsday specific considerations
 - Keeping BS held up for same turn wins
 - Casting one to leave two and consider what pitches to a Force
 - When to use everything to dig and when to hold in case find the win on same turn 
 - ???

Scenarios 
- Edge vs Wasteland (Ref recent Emidln match where he just ignored wasteland to have a same turn win with edge in hand)
- Dead on board with a cantrip and BS in hand?
- Using Edge to find a land vs casting to find the basic swamp to go off turn 3.
- Edge vs Street Wraith when you have 1 land and a Daze you wish to use.
- Starter hand with DR, Fetch, Sea, SW, Pre, Pn, BS - What is sequence?
- Dead on board if PTT, no cantrip in hand
