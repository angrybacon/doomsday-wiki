title: Gangster Trippin' - Cantrip discipline in Doomsday (and Legacy in general)
---

Everyone who has forayed into Legacy will know that the blue
*xerox* shell is very prevalent within the format. The shell
follows the school of thought that uses cheap, draw a card, effects
(colloquial known as cantrips) to enable sculpting of your hand
and finding answers when needed. There have already been a number
of articles that explore these theories by well known personalities
such as Reid Duke, AJ Sacher and Tomas Mar.

respectively.*

It was these articles and a questions from Doomsday Discord members 'Wally'
and 'Dale Cooper' that led to the inspiration to author this. Referring
back to the concept of the *xerox* shell, Doomsday is a prime example of this
in terms of deck construction. In fact, Meandeck Doomsday potentially boasts
the highest number of cantrips of any given archetype in Legacy running up to
a total of 18 replacement card draw effects within the main deck alone. 

In this article we hope to present the following points:

 - A summary of the cantrips and their purpose
 - The general principles of cantrip sequencing
 - Doomsday specific principles of cantrip sequencing
 - Discussion of example scenarios

## A summary of the cantrips involved

### Legacy Staples

The first suite of cantrips are what would be considered the *standard*
Legacy setup. Ponder and Brainstorm can be found of as 4-ofs in most
{U} based decks and Preordain as a 2-4 of in many as well.

#### {{Ponder}}

Ponder is powerful tool that allows you to 'see' 4 cards during
resolution. It is at its most powerful when paired with a fetchland
as this gives you the option to take the 'best' card of the first
three observed and shuffle away any potential unwanted pieces with 
the fetchland. Ponder is best suited for trying to find one specific
card which, for our intents and purposes, is normally Doomsday.

#### {{Preordain}}

Preordain is normally considered the 'weakest' of the classic suite.
Previously it has normally been relegated to combo decks who just
wanted additional filtering to find key pieces but is generally considered
weaker than Ponder as it sees 1 fewer cards. This point is in direct
contradiction to the wording presented in Reid's article.

> Preordain is ideal for digging to particular cards. This is why you
> see Preordain often in combo decks, but less often in fair decks like 
> Delver or Snow. Like Brainstorm, Preordain gets more powerful as the 
> game goes deeper, since you’ll have a clearer picture of what cards
> you’re looking for. 

I think the intent of the words is the same but the way they are presented
implies the opposite of the truth.

#### {{Brainstorm}}

Brainstorm has been described as a ['Pillar of the Format'](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/status/985674571188588544)
and is considered one of the most powerful spell effects in Legacy.
It acts as a way to 'see' 3 cards but can, in effect, give the ability
to exchange up to 2 cards from your hand, normally those considered
uneeded at the time, and get rid of them, again normally with the aid
of a fetchland. This in a sense can be viewed as almost drawing 3 cards
with some people comparing it to {{Ancestral Recall}}. 

### Free 'Cycling Effects'

This next pair are mostly unique to Doomsday however {{Death's Shadow}}
based decks will also make use of one of them. These are 'free' cycling 
cards that have little to no relevant text outside of their cycling
abilities (other than some specific circumstances). Their use is almost
always to provide a {0} mana draw effect after Doomsday has resolved.

#### {{Street Wraith}}

Street Wraith is used by Shadow decks to both thin out their draws
and to reduce their life total aggressively. For Doomsday it is
a  way to enable a lot of the piles made with the added benefit of
being a draw effect that is immune to normal countermagic. The
main downside of Street Wraith is the fact that, post Doomsday, 
your life total can be taxed quite heavily so having to rely on paying
2 or 4 life can be pretty punishing. Unlike Edge of Autumn however
it can be used even if you have played an aggressive hand via
Lotus Petals or if you need to retain a land to return with Daze
for example.

In some circumstances, it can be used as an additional win condition.
Casting a Street Wraith after your Doomsdays have been hit with a
{{Surgical Extraction}} effects or your opponent has paid 16 life
with {{Sylvan Library}} can be a legitimate way to win the game.
Against {B}{R} Reanimator there is also the potential to cycle it in
response to an {{Exhume}} whereby, thanks to the life paid to a
{{Griselbrand}} and the Swampwalk it can often present a lethal clock
out of nowhere.

For an excellent example of Street Wraith as a win condition please
watch [This Video](https://youtu.be/Eyi_R7QZiAc?t=2673) by Nevilshute
against {U}{B} Shadow.

#### {{Edge of Autumn}}

Edge of Autumn provides a method of cycling that is less taxing
on the manabase however can be of much less use outside of the
combo. Sacrificing a land can be a heavy costs however sometimes
it does mean you can mitigate the downside of a {{Wasteland}}
effect or similar by cycling in response. In a pinch you can also
use it to retrieve the third {B} source in the form of the basic
Swamp from the deck but the situations this is needed are far
and few between.

The thought process behind it mirrors that of the discard suite
utilised. Edge is effectively the equivalent of {{Duress}}. 
Although Duress is generally more narrow than {{Thoughtseize}}
in effect, the life loss can be significant so a mix is run
to provide maximum flexibility.

### Pile Enablers

The next pair are not cantrips in the traditional sense as they are more 
designed to provide raw card advantage in their use. Just like with the 
cycling cards, they tend to be considered primarily for their use within
Doomsday piles however they can have usage outside of this to varying
degrees. One is a well know staple for certain builds of Miracles and the 
other is a historical card from pre- {{Sensei's Divining Top}} ban DDFT
days. 

### {{Predict}}

Predict pairs effectively with other cantrips as you can use it to provide
additional filtering and raw card advantage. It also enables access to
Doomsday piles where you only have a single {U} available to dig into the pile
with. You can make use of effects like the reveal triggers on {{Delver of Secrets}}
or {{Counterbalance}} to gain advantage from your opponent's deck and,
in the mirror, it can even disrupt opposing Doomsday piles either milling
a key component or causing the pilot to inadvertently draw themselves to
death.

### {{Ideas Unbound}}

Ideas Unbound is a more effective card (resources allowing) during pile
construction but a weaker card outside of the combo. It can be used as
a large scale {{Faithless Looting}} effect to turn a land heavy hand
into a speall heavy hand. or provide an explosive boost of cards for 
a single turn, potentially enabling you to combo off there and then.

## Cantrip sequencing - General Principles

Normally, when playing a 'fair' Legacy deck, you need to filter through
your deck in order to find the balance of threats, protection and 
disruption depending on the situation. In a combo deck, this is normally
a bit more hyper-focussed to find the piece/pieces in order to 'go off'
as quickly as possible. More often in combo decks you will find yourself
shuffling off of Ponders or 'bottoming 2' off Preordains in order to
find what is needed.



Intro - reference Reid / Thomas E quote / SCG article
      - Give reasoning for why writing it
Give a summary of the cantrips
 - Ponder
 - Preordain
 - Brainstorm
 - SW
 - EoA




Debate of Trip vs Trip vs Trip?

Doomsday specific considerations
 - Keeping BS held up for same turn wins
 - Casting one to leave two and consider what pitches to a Force
 - When to use everything to dig and when to hold in case find the win on same turn 
 - ???

Scenarios 
- Edge vs Wasteland (Ref recent Emidln match where he just ignored wasteland to have a same turn win with edge in hand)
- Dead on board with a cantrip and BS in hand?
- Using Edge to find a land vs casting to find the basic swamp to go off turn 3.
- Edge vs Street Wraith when you have 1 land and a Daze you wish to use.
- Starter hand with DR, Fetch, Sea, SW, Pre, Pn, BS - What is sequence?
- Dead on board if PTT, no cantrip in hand
