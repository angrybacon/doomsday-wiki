title: Gangster Trippin' - Cantrip discipline in Doomsday (and Legacy in general)
---

Everyone who has forayed into Legacy will know that the blue
*xerox* shell is very prevalent within the format. The shell
follows the school of thought that uses cheap, draw a card, effects
(colloquial known as cantrips) to enable sculpting of your hand
and finding answers when needed. There have already been a number
of articles that explore these theories by well known personalities
such as Reid Duke, AJ Sacher and Tomas Mar.

respectively.*

It was these articles and a questions from Doomsday Discord members 'Wally'
and 'Dale Cooper' that led to the inspiration to author this. Referring
back to the concept of the *xerox* shell, Doomsday is a prime example of this
in terms of deck construction. In fact, Meandeck Doomsday potentially boasts
the highest number of cantrips of any given archetype in Legacy running up to
a total of 18 replacement card draw effects within the main deck alone. 

In this article we hope to present the following points:

 - A summary of the cantrips and their purpose
 - The general principles of cantrip sequencing
 - Doomsday specific principles of cantrip sequencing
 - Discussion of example scenarios

## A summary of the cantrips involved

The first suite of cantrips are what would be considered the *standard*
Legacy setup. Ponder and Brainstorm can be found of as 4-ofs in most
{U} based decks and Preordain as a 2-4 of in many as well.

### {{Ponder}}

Make note of counter-point to Reid's article here?

### {{Preordain}}

Make reference to Tomas' main Preordain vs Ponder point here?

### {{Brainstorm}}


This next pair are mostly unique to Doomsday however {{Death's Shadow}}
based decks will also make use of one of them. These are 'free' cycling 
cards that have little to no relevant text outside of their cycling
abilities (other than some specific circumstances). Their use is almost
always to provide a {0} mana draw effect after Doomsday has resolved.

### {{Street Wraith}}

### {{Edge of Autumn}}

Make comparison to Edge vs Wraith as per Tsz vs Duress here?


The next pair are not cantrips in the traditional sense as they are more 
designed to provide raw card advantage in their use. Just like with the 
cycling cards, they tend to be considered primarily for their use within
Doomsday piles however they can have usage outside of this to varying
degrees. One is a well know staple for certain builds of Miracles and the 
other is a historical card from pre- {{Sensei's Divining Top}} ban DDFT
days.

========================================
Intro - reference Reid / Thomas E quote / SCG article
      - Give reasoning for why writing it
Give a summary of the cantrips
 - Ponder
 - Preordain
 - Brainstorm
 - SW
 - EoA




Debate of Trip vs Trip vs Trip?

Doomsday specific considerations
 - Keeping BS held up for same turn wins
 - Casting one to leave two and consider what pitches to a Force
 - When to use everything to dig and when to hold in case find the win on same turn 
 - ???

Scenarios 
- Edge vs Wasteland (Ref recent Emidln match where he just ignored wasteland to have a same turn win with edge in hand)
- Dead on board with a cantrip and BS in hand?
- Using Edge to find a land vs casting to find the basic swamp to go off turn 3.
- Edge vs Street Wraith when you have 1 land and a Daze you wish to use.
- Starter hand with DR, Fetch, Sea, SW, Pre, Pn, BS - What is sequence?
- Dead on board if PTT, no cantrip in hand
