title: Doomsday in 2017
---

We shall begin with a Pixar-esque bittersweet beginning. The deck is working,
people are happy, we can run maindeck Abrupt Decay yet still deploy triple
basics to fight the Miracles menace and then bam: Some idiot erects a roadsign
and Wizards cripples a lot of creative decks to target a single one, which they
fail to kill. Suddenly it's over. So many people, so many of the deck's pilots
have had the final straw. They are done, that's it. Game over.

Is it the end?

I hope not...

2017 has been a difficult year for Doomsday as an archetype primarily due to the
SDT ban. A lot of it was spent trying to work out any and all possible
replacements, both card wise and playstyle wise. A lot of people switched to ANT
as in their mind the deck had lost the one benefit over it's bigger sister in
terms of card selection, advantage and resilience.

I talk with a lot of people about the deck but one of the people I talk most
with is Nanda aka Namida. He is a Doomsday veteran who resides in Japan and has
always been a helpful and insightful voice on the Stormboards, TheSource,
MtGSalvation forums and on the Doomsday Facebook group. One morning I awoke to
find a veritable essay from him and his feelings on where the deck was right
now. We had a very big debate over that essay with some strong points and
feelings being conveyed from both sides.

I will avoid posting the full debate but I do want to use his points to address
a lot of the frustrations pilots, both current and old, are having with the deck
and hopefully give some comfort to those still playing, maybe even enticing some
people back. I am looking to address each point truthfully. Although I have
stated my goals I will not sugar coat things and there are some things that
cannot be changed about the deck so I am not expecting a mass conversion of
people but even if I can persuade one or two, I will be happy!

For many points I will not just be talking shit out of nowhere. Back in November
I started a mini project to begin collecting statistics about the deck and I
have put a call out to anyone who can to provide match results for the deck.
These results have a number of data points that are needed to be considered
*good data. I also stressed to all submitting I wanted all reports. All wins,
losses, draws. I was not looking to get a rose-tinted view but instead wanted an
accurate snapshot of how the deck was performing. This mix of pilots also
allowed a mix of experienced and new people to get involved hopefully allowing a
wide range of data sources and to minimise pilot variance to allow the deck
itself to shine through results wise. The results pool is still small at the
time of writing (337 matches recorded) but it still provides a good starting
snapshot to get an idea of how the deck is doing. Any results involving the
mirror match have been ommitted for any statistics involving game results.

Although I am presenting these statistics this article is just using them to
help answer questions. I am planning to release a full article soon to properly
describe and present the data and stats collected from the data so if any
explanation is missing regarding the data that is presented here, it should be
addressed in this later article.

Without further ado, and continuing on the Disney theme...

## Let's Get Down to Business

Here are Nanda's opening points:

This block actually contains two points in one as I see it.

### The deck is Inconsistent

The idea is that you have to choose whether to use cantrips to sculpt or to hold
for the combo turn. Doomsday is unique insofar that cantrips double as combo
elements to either draw into the stack, exchange between the stack and your
hand, draw into a kill elements or draw to win with LM.

I will admit that yes, you do have to make these choices however that is
unfortunately the core of the deck and the element that makes it unique to both
TES and ANT. DDFT probably has the most elements of choice and the most
potential decision points per turn. This is not even taking into account
actually resolving the namesake card. Use of cantrips and lands/fetches has
always been the hardest element of the deck and the most crucial. Saying that
though, the current iterations of the deck I think play the most number of
cantrips of any. Along with the U combo triplet of Brainstorm, Ponder and
Gitaxian Probe we also run a number of Preordains and / or Conjurer's Baubles
both of which add to the cantrip count. We are, like any deck in a game with
some level of variance, at the whimsy of fate however unlike many decks we do
have the tools to minimise that variance.

To work through this let us start by looking at our levels of variance,
specifically, as Nanda mentioned, our opening hands. Mulligans were tracked
across all games of a match and the win percentages calculated from when
mulligans occur. Below you can find two graphs: the percentage of games where
mulligans occur and the percentage of games won against mulligans.

![Mulligan percentage across games](/media/pictures/2017.chart.mulligan.gif)

![Mulligan win percentage across games](/media/pictures/2017.chart.mulligan-win.gif)

As you can see, despite the concerns, the deck seems to mulligan very well.
There could be some variance in that people are keeping dodgy seven card hands
for fear of hitting a bad six however with the scry rule in effect, going down
to six is certainly not the end of the world. This is also shown to be the case
in the second graph. Seven cards have a very good win rate with a heavy
reduction as one mulligans to six and to five. One thing to note is how few data
points there actually are for mulligans to five or less showing some severe data
changes for the win percentage across these points. As a result nothing solid
can be inferred from these low points but I I hope the fact that the number of
these results being so low is a testament to the general consistency of the deck
itself.

Yes you will have garbage hands. We run some oddball cards that our often
useless outside of an active combo turn and sometimes variance can really kick
you in the proverbial nuts but most of the time, at least according to the
numbers, we seem to be doing fine.

### Making {B}{B}{B} for a Quick DD Without DR is Difficult

One of the issues with the deck is that the namesake card does require BBB to
cast. This is an interesting element with a deck that is primarily U. In terms
of options for creating BBB we have Dark Ritual as a four of. Rain of Filth as a
potential one of. Lotus Petal as a four of and generally four lands that make B
(normally 2 Seas, 1 Badlands and 1 Swamp). Nanda is correct in saying that DR is
the best way to make BBB quickly however it is far from the only way. Two lands
and a lotus petal is often enough or even one land and two petals can occur
often.

> *...a lot of my Doomsday wins were actually off of Burning Wish, Top and LED
> mana.*

We also have the option thanks to Conjurer's Bauble to play out Doomsday on turn
2 via Burning Wish and two LEDs thereby replicating the 'saved' draw effect we
gained from SDT. One of the more well known recent achievements of the deck, the
5-0 result from an MTGO by g0ld_rook had him run four CB and he noted that he
had under appreciated the saved draw effect gained by them during early testing
with them.

This point feeds into some of Nanda's later comments:

> *...I'm sure the deck is fine if the game is going long, but I feel completely
> toothless in the early game. If your hand isn't perfect then you're not racing
> most fast decks, and that means you have to use your cantrips more
> aggressively and I don't think that's a winning proposition when every card
> you spend to look is actually costing a full card now.*

Which creates a third point:

### Doomsday is Not a Fast Enough Combo Deck

Of the *classic* Legacy Storm variants you have three main camps (though some
would argue only two). ANT, DDFT and TES. In order of speed it has always been
considered to order TES as the fastest, ANT as second and DDFT as the slowest.
This has often been true as TES sacrifices deterministic wins for speed and DDFT
sacrificed speed for resiliency and card advantage. Now that SDT is gone where
does the deck stand on this scale?

For this comparison I will be using data taken from two spreadsheets linked in
an article written by Bryant Cook on the TES website. A link will be provided at
the end for those interested in the article. To summarise it; Bryant took game
data from a TES pilot and an ANT pilot and compared a number of factors
including one listed as "Active Combo turn". This turn has been tracked on a
scale of T1 to T4+ with the theory that beyond T4 there is little difference for
a deck concerned about being fast between say T5 and T20. As part of my data
gathering I also collected combo turn statistics. This is the turn the combo
occurs so if you are executing a DD pass-the-turn pile it is the turn you cast
Doomsday to make the pile, not the turn you win on. This can create some results
skewing but I will address that a bit more in a moment. First let's look at the
raw data.

Data collated on 03/01/2018:

| Deck | Average Combo Turn |
| :--: | :----------------: |
| ANT  | 3.01               |
| DDFT | 2.95               |
| TES  | 2.61               |

Wait what?

Yeah, that's what I said when I first crunched the numbers. How is DDFT,
traditionally the slowpoke of the Legacy Storm world being on par if not a tad
faster than ANT?! There are a few reasons for this, partially to do with the
data skew I mentioned before. This can include turns where we "go off" without
winning on that turn. This can mean that the "combo turn" may be the turn before
we actually win (potentially as many as five turns prior to winning) which could
skew the data. This also includes us using something in our arsenal which mimics
that which TES has: Burning Wish into Empty the Warrens. This can be an early
play which, even if only making ten or so gobbos can lead to fast wins. This
does mean that the data will skew towards earlier turns but also means the TES
data is affected by this bias. In the interest of transparency, it's worth
noting that the DDFT data was recorded with a scale of 1-5+ turns, which has
been converted to correspond with the TES and ANT range of 1-4+.

When discussing this point regarding speed with Nanda he made the following
comments:

> *Doomsday is being carried on the back of Burning Wish at that point is how it
> has been feeling. Not like Doomsday is doing anything powerful, but that we're
> playing a faster Storm deck with pet cards instead of the cards that make it a
> consistently fast threat. I've been liking when I draw Burning Wish in these
> versions of the deck because we have so much fast mana. I have felt miserable
> anytime I had a Doomsday in hand...*
>
> *...I want to be wrong about the deck not winning in a timely manner, but I
> can't reconcile the idea that the mana is too awkward for Doomsday to
> consistently be a Turn 2/3 threat without having to spend cards you may not be
> able to afford spending. That sums up the issue for me, I think.*

This gives us point 4:

### Doomsday is Now Just a Worse ANT/TES

These are fair comments. It is true that cards like Past in Flames are
incredibly powerful engines that in many situations are less akward and more
consistent than Doomsday itself. Our data above including EtW results definately
skews it faster so what if we take out those results and consider only the wins
that use the deck's namesake card? We'll also have a look at the breakdown in
how the deck actually goes about winning to work out how much the statement
of...

> *...we're playing a faster Storm deck with pet cards instead of the cards that
> make it a consistently fast threat...*

...is true.

| Deck | Average Combo Turn |
| :--: | :----------------: |
| ANT  | 3.01               |
| DDFT | 2.99               |
| TES  | 2.61               |

Focussing only on the DD winning lines we see the turn average has definately
gone up but is still on par with ANT. Following on from this point again Nanda
had real concerns that Doomsday as a deck was not winning using its namesake
card. Let's look at the breakdown of winning game engines:

![Combo engines across games](/media/pictures/2017.chart.engines.gif)

I guess that paints a clear picture. The four engines measured are the primary
ones of any line that uses Doomsday itself, BW into EtW, natural ToA kills and
then anything else (such as weird SB plans or other alternatives like Telemin
Performance). We can see that a vastly overwhelming majority is using the
namesake card. Does this make the deck better than the others? No, not
inherently. Does it mean that it is unique enough to not be a bad TES/ANT clone?
Yes, I think so.

Nanda ended his message with the following final point to make:

> *Sorry for the rant earlier. It's frustrating because it feels like having to
> learn to walk after losing a leg. Is no one else feeling this way? I want to
> stay the course but I keep getting discouraged by how even just my goldfishing
> is playing out.*

Which gives a final point of:

### Post SDT Ban DDFT is Not the Same as Pre-Ban DDFT

Now I have no fancy stats or graphs for this. It's true. DDFT is a different
deck now. We have only made a few changes, going from 16 lands to 15, replacing
IU with AoI, upping to 4 BW and using Preordain and Conjurer's Baubles but they
are noticeable ones and yes, it will take time to re-learn. Cantripping is now
even more important, knowing when and how to use each card is key and the sheer
number of potential tricks you can do thanks to exiling via AoI is crazy but it
does take time. Many, myself included have had to go back to the basics of the
deck which can really make you feel down. I don't blame anyone who has put the
deck down for good as a result of this frustration. You're not alone. I will
however say that DDFT is still alive, it's still relatively competitive (overall
match win % at the time of writing is 56.69%) and it is still a lot of fun to
play, punishing as all hell when it goes wrong and a highly rewarding deck when
it goes right.

## Closing Thoughts

I'm sorry for this information splurge as it is a lot to take in.

At the end of this article resolving we are left with the following five point
stack having been addressed:

1. The deck is inconsistent.  
   **No more than any combo deck**
2. Making {B}{B}{B} for a quick DD without DR is difficult.  
   **Potentially but often not**
3. Doomsday is not a fast enough deck.  
   **Slower than TES, as fast as ANT**
4. Doomsday is now just a worse ANT/TES.  
   **DDFT is its own style, not just a clone**
5. Post SDT ban, DDFT is not the same as pre-ban DDFT.  
   **Correct and we as pilots have to work through this**

Hopefully this has helped you as the reader come to make a decision whether to
put the deck down, pick the deck up or just understand what happened to the deck
in general. As stated at the start; I have presented a small cross section of
statistics to help answer some of these points but these are a small taster of
what we have been tracking. In the near future I plan to write a more detailed
article simply going through the stats and giving more information on how they
are collected which should help explain any further data bias concerns people
might have on what is said here.

If you wish to contribute to our community data collection for the deck you can
find the link to the spreadsheet below.  
If you wish to collect the data but not in a public forum then please feel free
to take a copy of the spreadsheet and if you could send that link to Doishy via
theSource forum or the Stormboards that would be appreciated. A couple of people
currently do this for the sake of running their own trending but if we could use
the data for overall trending, that would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading!
