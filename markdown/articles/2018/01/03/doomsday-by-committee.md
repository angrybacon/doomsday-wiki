_Eye of twilight, give us sight.  
Take our offer, give us might.  
Make our power tears of night._

_Guys do we intend to try and beckon forth power through the Eye of twilight?  
Why, what's wrong with the Eye of twilight?  
I'm sure there are more powerful entities out there.  
Like whom?  
Hanarsh the soul taker? We have virgins right here...  
No! Look, Eye of twilight is the best otherworldly entity that may be willing
to grant unholy power.So he is what we will reach out to. Understand?  
Fine.  
Sure.  
Okay. Where were we... Eye of twilight, give us sight..._

_Do we really always have to wear black?_

Hello and welcome to the first of what will hopefully be a series of articles
whereby some players get together and either observe and discuss live games with
DDFT or go over scenarios presented by people. The idea behind this is to try
and work through the decision process used by different people, to help
highlight how different people think and to hopefully provide meaningful
examples that give lessons others can take away and apply to their own play.

In this first ritual meeting we have two members of the
_super-secret-shadowy-Doomsday-cabal_ &trade; \*

d8dk32 and Doishy playing through some games of an MTGO league. Instead of doing
a complete breakdown of every game instead we'll just focus on some of the more
thought provoking or interesting decision points and provide some insight into
our respective discussion of those points and how the decision came about,
whether it was correct and whether it worked (because those two can be mutually
exclusive!).

It's d8dk32's list and he is the primary pilot and will be explaining most of
the scenarios. Doishy is watching and will add further commentary.

The decklist:

## Scenario 1

We are on the play and started with a Misty Rainforest. Opponent leads Turn one
Verdant Catacombs and passes. We play a Badlands, crack the fetch for an Island,
and cast Preordain, which brings us to here:

Doishy and I quickly agree that we go for it here. By leaving both cards on top
and drawing Doomsday, we can cast Doomsday and win that way if it resolves, and
if not we Brainstorm into a Burning Wish for a lethal Tendrils (including the
extra storm from the counterspell). In this case, Doomsday resolved and we had
to decide how to build our pile. Our storm count was already plenty high so we
only needed four cards in the pile to achieve lethal storm. There were two
options available to us for what to do with the 5th slot:

A. Hide the Laboratory Maniac at the bottom of the pile.  
B. Use the spare card to Gitaxian Probe to see what they are on.

### What is the correct play?

We decided on choice A, to hide the Lab Man, thinking that there was more to be
gained from having a trick up our sleeve. We only briefly discussed what the
opponent could be on and sort of assumed it was Czech Pile and they got caught
with their pants down. For game two we sideboarded conservatively, swapping a
Therapy for the sideboard Thoughtseize. Unfortunately, game two was a bit of a
blowout that started with a turn one Chalice@1 from the opponent, who of course
is playing 4C Loam (Aggro Loam). In hindsight this potentially could have been
avoided by choosing choice B.

Knowing how to sideboard properly is important, and losing the suprise factor of
the Lab Man plan is insignificant in comparison, especially considering the
matchup. Compared to Czech Pile, a deck like 4C Loam requires much more specific
sideboarding to fight back in games two and three. Furthermore, this is a good
example of how format familiarity goes beyond simply knowing what spells a deck
plays. Czech Pile rarely plays more than one or two Verdant Catacombs, if any,
whereas it is essentially always a four-of in 4C Loam.

Doishy's comments:

> especially given most relevant boarding from our opponent is based upon the

> crucial and seeing seven points of information is much better than hiding one.

## Scenario 2

It is our turn three in game two vs Elves. They have Gaea's Cradle, Cavern of
Souls, Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger in play, with Dryad Arbor and Cabal
Therapy in hand. Our board consists of tapped Tropical Island, untapped Swamp,
and Lotus Petal, and our hand is Brainstorm, Doomsday, and Dark Ritual. Our life
total is still relatively high so we have an easy opening for a pass-the-turn
pile with Lab Maniac. The important question here is what to put in the pile. To
answer this question, we need to consider what disruption they could have and
what of that we can even play around.

![MTGO Screenshot](/media/pictures/2018.ritual-doomsday.two.jpeg 'Scenario 2')

The pile that quickly jumps to mind is a _basic_ pile like \[AoI, LED, LM, GP,
GP\]. This neatly plays around Therapy, and the 4 life paid is fine in this
situation. The problem with this pile is it requires the use of the Petal to
cast AoI, meaning they'll have a turn to find something like Reclamation Sage
for the blowout.

You could build \[LED, AoI, LED, GP, LM\] and use the Brainstorm in hand to kick
things off next turn. This doesn't require the use of the Petal but could be
ruined if they find a black mana source to cast Therapy.

They could potentially draw Surgical Extraction as well. Using the Brainstorm in
hand to draw into the pile would improve the odds of getting the right cards
even if the our pile got shuffled.

We thought for a bit about what pile would beat the most kinds of hate but just
went with the _basic_ Maniac pile since Therapy seemed most likely happen and to
avoid running down the clock too much. This pile ended up working fine, but no
sooner had we committed to it than Doishy came up with a better pile: \[Volc,
AoI, LM, LED, GP\]. With this, we can hold the Brainstorm and if they Therapy or
play artifact destruction on their turn simply cast Brainstorm off Petal to draw
the Volcanic Island, dodging both kinds of hate. Volc will be the red source for
AoI next turn. Otherwise, we'll hang onto the brainstorm until our next turn.
Draw the Volc, crack the petal to brainstormn into AoI, play the Volc and win.
If at any point they cast Surgical, we Brainstorm after it resolves and hope the
pieces we need are in the top three.

## Scenario 3

We've just lost game one to RUG Delver and are in the process of sideboarding.
The question of whether to bring in Xantid Swarm comes up. It is obviously
powerful if it sticks around, but dies easily to Bolt. This can be a difficult
matchup if the RUG player has a countermagic-loaded hand. After some discussion
we decide to bring in Swarm, reasoning that Bolt is only four cards and their
only good way to remove it. Our game two mull to six let us cast Swarm on turn
one, with Ritual and a Wish already in hand, a good start. However the Swarm
immediately dies to Bolt, leaving us way behind on tempo and vulnerable to
Wastelands since we had to use Tropical Island. It's possible that playing Swarm
right away was incorrect, but since the aim was to go off in the next turn or
two it seemed best to run it out immediately.

So back to the question at hand, is Xantid Swarm good against RUG Delver, and
Delver decks more broadly? I think the answer is "no". I used to think of Swarm
as an easy solution for all manner of blue decks but this discussion has started
to change my opinion. Xantid Swarm is a less popular choice for Storm sideboards
lately but Delver will often keep Bolts anyway as a hedge against Xantid Swarm
and as reach. Swarm can also be blocked by flipped Delvers, which decreases its
usefulness in the pre-combo turns. Finally, against Delver variants in general,
countermagic is expected and we can fight through that; it's the additional axis
they attack on that causes the problem. In RUG, this is mana denial, and in
Grixis, this is discard. Swarm doesn't really help against either of these. I
think these sideboard slots could be used in a better way, although I'm not
quite sure how yet.

Doishy's comments:

> I personally was against Swarm coming in. Locally my meta is full of Grixis
> Delver variants and all run Bolt, even post board as, if nothing else, it
> forces us to consider whether we can go off and lose half our life in the face

> logic. We reasoned that because Storm doesn't play a lot of it now, the
> opponent would likely not be prepared to face it. What we should have

> prevalent.

## Bonus Discussion

Over the course of the four rounds we played, Doishy noticed that I was bringing
in Thoughtseize every round and suggested I play it maindeck. In the past I have
been averse to playing Thoughtseize anywhere in the seventy-five because I
thought the two life would relevant. It took a lot to convince me to even play
it in the sideboard, so the idea of maindecking it never crossed my mind.
However, if you're sideboarding something in every single match, you ought to at
least consider maindecking it. As such, I am now testing three Duress, three
Therapy, one Thoughtseize main, with the fourth Therapy in the board. The two
life from Thoughtseize has not been as relevant as I anticipated and the
flexibility it provides is useful. Not needing to guess what hatebear an
opponent is holding, being able to take a Snapcaster that would flashback a
Flusterstorm, being able to see the opponent's hand before deciding whether to
take Force of Will or Leovold, all of these are realistic scenarios where
Thoughtseize is potentially better than Duress or Therapy. However, the life
loss would quickly add up so I don't think I want it in multiples just yet.

Doishy's comments:

> This observation was in some part due to the fact that d8 would not simply add
> in an extra discard spell but swap it out for a Therapy. There was also some
> bias here as for the last year I have been running a Miser's Thoughtseize main
> and it whas been very strong, especially in the face of Thalias or Eidolons so
> much so that I have consider switching from three Therapy, two Duress one
> Thoughtseize main to three Therapy, one Duress and two Thoughtseize main.

## Parting Thoughts

d8dk32's comments:

> I often talk to myself when I play online, but it's much more informative to
> talk to someone else who also knows your deck. Hopefully reading this and any
> future articles we publish will help people learning to play this deck, but I
> think this pair-playing process is a valuable learning tool and if you can
> find a willing partner would be an excellent way to learn on your own. Just as
> important as learning to build piles is learning how to make the plays in the
> early turns to reach the point where you get to build piles. Having someone to
> watch over your shoulder helps you play better by catching mistakes and
> providing a sounding board when the best line isn't clear. Doishy and I agreed
> on most things this time but discussing the reasoning behind our choices is
> helpful regardless.

Doishy's comments:

> I for one really enjoyed watching d8 play whilst we discussed decisions. What
> made me feel confidant was, barring some of the decision points above, we
> quite often agreed very quickly on what line to take with most being the
> correct one. In addition to the above we had a classic turn two "Do we jam?"
> vs what turned out to be an Esper Stoneblade/Delver variant. We both said yes
> and it was 100% correct given the circumstances. One thing that it made clear
> to me is how important it is having these very fluid conversations during
> gameplay. Although people at my local shops know me and my deck of choice none
> of them really "know" the deck to the point where I could properly discuss my
> card choices, play choices and similar.

Hopefully you enjoyed this first installment of Doomsday by Committee. We shall
hopefully return with more of the _super-secret-shadowy-Doomsday-cabal_ &trade;
that might not exist with further discussion on other play points, opening
hands, scenarios and occasional puzzles.

Thank you for reading!
