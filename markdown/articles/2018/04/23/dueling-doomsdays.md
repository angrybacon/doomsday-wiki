## Setting the scene

One week prior to the event our local Legacy Judgette suddenly fired out info of
a GPT, one of those hasn't been seen in ages, but it's Legacy and
it's local.  
Saturday the 7th of April: 19 players converged into Firestorm games despite the
short notice and terrible weather (like wow it was bad). Five rounds of Swiss
with cut to Top 8. Thanks to the lovely judges we gave the full metagame
breakdown:

- Standstill
- Lands x2
- Doomsday x2
- Infect
- ANT
- Aluren
- Turbo Depths
- Death and Taxes
- Grixis Delver
- Golgari Prison
- Elves
- Miracles
- BUG Delver
- Omnisneak/tell x3
- Maverick

No Chalice decks (yay) and only one Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V out. As you can see Doomsday
made up a significant portion of the metagame (10.5%!) with myself (Doishy) and
ApeofJustice representing.

Let's get into it. Reports written by their respective pilots:

### Round 1

**Player: ApeofJustice  
Opponent: Ben (the eventual tournament winner)  
Opposing Deck: ANT  
Result: 1-2**

Playing against Ben (the eventual tournament winner), who I knew was playing
ANT even before going into the match. On the draw.  
G1) I get killed on T1, oh well, what you gunna do. Can’t help that’s just how
it sometimes goes.  
G2) This game was quite grindy, with lots of hand disruption thrown between each
player, Ben does a mini Tendrils against me quite early on. I soon draw a
Surgical Extraction, and target
his Tendrils of Agony; Ben concedes in response. Obviously didn’t side in or
maindeck any Empty the Warrens.  
G3) On the draw I keep a hand that is solid with some disruption, mana and DD,
but no cantrips. Ben kept a 7 so I didn’t feel I could justify going below with
this serviceable hand. Ben just Ponders on his turn, shuffles, then passes. I
feel somewhat confident with the shuffle, and draw another Doomsday for turn. I
Duress him on my T1, and take a Brainstorm seeing a hand of Flooded Strand,
Lotus Petal, LED, and 2 Cabal Rituals. Then with no cantrips, I don’t feel
confident letting this game going long, so I set up a pass the turn pile with
Laboratory Maniac, going straight to 10 life. If he draws a tutor, or the
Tendrils I die, but that is only a 5 outer, so Im quite happy playing against
those odds. Ben hits a Ponder, shuffles, and hits the Tutor. GG

**Player: Doishy  
Opponent: Sammie  
Opposing Deck: Miracles  
Result: 0-2**

Round 1 vs Sammie on Miracles. I have played him before and he was on a UW
Delver brew so I suspected counterspells et al. I have an early combo but he has
maindeck fluster! I rebuild and try to find things but a Mentor gets going and I
get pressured. I have the kill ready but after checking the coast he has
counterspell, SCM x2 and that first Fluster in the yard. I manage to bait the
CSpell, Thoughtseize a Snappy but he still has the last. Here I had a line
whereby I could bait the Fluster with a DD and then grab a second DD off the top
to then win (or maybe it was BW into ToA or something?) basically I go to bait
with DD and he lets it resolve....oh dear! I have to go for it but he has the
Fluster and hits something and Mentor tokens kill me because I don't have enough
resources to make a pile involving a CT first or anything ( not that it would
help). Game 2 I have a really nice opener with a Trop and Xantid. He starts T0
with Leyline of Sanct. Huh, well should be fine if Swarm hits. I T1 Swarm and we
stick it. He T1 goes land and Brainstorm. I cantrip and set up a T3 kill. He
flips a Terminus (SALT ALERT SEGWAY: WHY THE FUCK DOES HE STILL HAVE THIS CARD
IN HIS DECK? LIKE COME ON, REALLY....FFS (Sidenote: Turns out he thought he did
not have enough good cards to board in so had to keep some bad ones.....he had
one left in the deck.)) So anyways I go for it anyway and meet and Flusterstorm
for my troubles. Again I try to rebuild but cannot interact meaningfully thanks
to Leyline and not having boarded in any Bounce spells. I die to Mentor tokens
and feel pretty angry.

### Round 2

**Player: ApeofJustice  
Opponent: Morgan  
Opposing Deck: Sneak and Show  
Result: 2-0**

Playing against Morgan, who seemed to be somewhat new to the format. We all
start somewhere. On the play.  
G1) Morgan mulligans to 6 cards and scrys to the top. I keep a pretty solid hand
with cantrips, mana and a burning wish. I T1 probe him, for information and see
a pretty weak keep with Volcanic Island, Island, Mountain, Flooded Strand, Lotus
Petal, and Force of Will. Seems pretty clearly on some UR Show and Tell variant.
Draw a duress from the probe which I use to take that Force and pass. Morgan
just plays a land and passes, I draw a therapy and take that Petal, seeing the
scry to the top was a Griselbrand; confirm my assumption of SnT. I DR, BW, DD
into a Pass the Turn pile. Kill
him the next turn.  
G2) I keep a very solid hand with Probe, Therapy, Therapy, Thoughtseize, Fetch,
BW, LP. Morgan on the play plays a land, lotus petal, ponder (shuffle) and
passes. I draw a LED. Probe him seeing Boseiju, Flusterstorm, Show and Tell,
Spell Pierce, and Brainstorm. Draw a Dark Ritual off the Probe and go Dark Rit,
Thoughtseize, Double therapy, leaving him with the Brainstorm, and Boseiju. I go
a couple more draw-gos with Morgan. I manage to brainstorm into Probe, Probe,
Duress. Duress him see the coast is clear, play out my mana, and probe into the
Probe then BW I put back ontop (With him on 19 and my storm currently 6), to go
for an Empty the warrens for
16 goblins, and then flash back the 2 therapies from T1. He draws nothing
relevant and concedes.

**Player: Doishy  
Opponent: Justin  
Opposing Deck: BUG Delver  
Result: 2-1**

Round 2 I face Justin on BUG Delver. I get the play and probe seeing a classic
BUG hand. I Duress away a Force of Will and T2 therapy away a Daze. He drops a
Goyf T2 and I respond with 16 Goblins and a Flashbacked Therapy hitting Abrupt
Decay T3. He scoops to my superior creature
base!  
Game 2 I have the T1 unprotected. I jam it, he has a Surgical. Ah well.  
Game 3, We trade some resources then somewhere I find the spot to go off with
Doomsday but cannot hit the needed storm count so I manage to build a DD EtW
pile with at least two turns
left of draw steps with 18 Goblins in play. He scoops. DD EtW pile. WUT?!  
This round I also enjoyed watching the lands mirror occurring to my left XD

### Round 3

**Player: ApeofJustice  
Opponent: Josh  
Opposing Deck: Turbo Depths  
Result: 0-2**

Playing against Josh, running Turbo Depths. On the Draw.  
G1) In the blind, I keep a fair 7, with a BW, DR, LP, Island, Fetch, Ponder,
Brainstorm. Josh leads with Urborg, then Needles Wasteland primitively. I draw
another land, and feel obliged to Wish for a Therapy to name Vampire Hexmage as
a response to the threatening T2 Marit Lage. Therapy reveals 3 Lotus Petals, 1
Elvish Spirit Guide, and a Crop Rotation. Josh topdecks an Expedition Map,
tutors a Dark Depths and plays it, leaving a LP in play and ESG and a Rotation
in hand. I know I’m dead next turn. Hope he misses it. I Brainstorm into cards
to set up a PTT pile, attempt to set it up, but Josh makes a 20/20 in response
to the Doomsday, and I concede.  
G2) Josh mulligans to 6 and scrys to the top. That scry feels a little
threatening, I keep a solid hand with a T1 Thoughtseize, T2 Kill. I Thoughtseize
him, seeing Dark Depths, Stage, Karakas, Snow-covered Forest, Catacombs, and my
only option of a Duress. Feel quietly hopeful. Turns out his scry was a
Thoughtseize as well, and he takes my doomsday, and I proceed to cast my only
cantrip (ponder) find 3 lands, shuffle draw a land, then continue flooding out.
He Marit Lages on T3 with a petal he drew.

**Player: Doishy  
Opponent: Mark  
Opposing Deck: Copy Paste  
Result: 0-2**

Round 3 was against Mark on Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. He is a Bristol local so both of us
know the score. G1 we manage to strip each other of hand resources but I have a
good stable manabase and CB in play (perfect start in the matchup). I need to
find one last piece so have to aggressively cantrip. I get rewarded by drawing
lands three turns in a row to then find the kill (unprotected) in the face of
lethal on the board and of course he has the force (I cannot Goblins due to
double Flying Delvers).  
Game 2 starts off with an early Carpet (yay) and him getting manascrewed (WHAT?)
so his one land, T1 Delver, many Dazes hand does serious work as I cannot
leverage my Carpet advantage, get beaten by the bug and then get into another
turn where I have either the deterministic kill unprotected or a YOLO CT + blind
AoI what I think needed to be either an LED or DR to win? (It might have had to
be two cards maybe...) basically I went for it (deterministic kill) because I
knew his hand was a R blast that I could ignore and 2 unknowns and hey, the
unknowns were of course FoW and blue card. Blergh.

### Round 4

**Player: ApeofJustice  
Opponent: Mark  
Opposing Deck: Infect
Result: 2-1**

Playing against Mark who I knew is on Infect. I feel it’s a bad match up, and
know that losing this would put me out of top 8 contention. Unfortunately for
Mark, he shows up a tad late to the match and received a
game loss, so the match started 1-0 in my favour. On the draw.  
G1) I keep a slow grindy hand. Mark sticks a T1 Glistener Elf, and I die on T4
due to not hitting the action in my disruption and cantrip heavy hand.  
G2) Mark mulligans to 6 and scrys to the top, I keep a T2 kill if I draw a
cantrip or LED. I have a Thoughtseize but decide to play a land and hold the
thoughtseize, since I have the mana to cast it and combo next turn if I can draw
the cantrip. Mark plays a T1 Pithing Needle on LED and I inform him that it is
infact a mana ability – feels bad man. (Editor's note: Mark knows better than
this and I did slap him after because he's a pillock) I get the cantrip,
Thoughtseize him, and see his only interaction was a Flusterstorm, which I take,
then proceed to standard pile ToA kill him.

**Player: Doishy  
Opponent: Rosie  
Opposing Deck: Lands  
Result: 2-0**

Round 4 I get the bye aka Lands.  
Game 1 she plays lands, I cantrip. As she ends her second turn she says "I know
you're on Doomsday, but how does it actually work" to which I reply as I draw
for turn "Let me show you". I do my thing explaining each step then stack a
Tendrils of Agony with 11 copies about to appear when she states she has a
response. I know she has nothing in hand other than a Crop Rotation so I wonder
what she plans to get. She rotates and grabs a Glacial Chasm and smugly puts it
into play. I say okay and ask if Storm triogger may resolve. She says yes so I
point 12 Tendrils at her. She then points at Chasm to which I inform her
regarding the wording difference of Damage vs Lifeloss. She looks
confused and queries it so I helpfully call the Judge to explain.  
Game 2 I probe to see a Choke in her hand (oh boy!). So I play a weirdly
aggressive non U fetch game getting basic Island, Swamp and Badlands into play.
She actually drops a T2 Sphere of Resistance so cannot cast Choke until T4
because she also blocks a Mox Diamond she draws with the Sphere. I CT the Choke
and manage to find a CoV. I enter T4 with four lands, the kill and CoV in hand.
She drops a second choke. On her end step I QUICK MATHS (man's not hot) and work
out I don't need my Island to win so Chain and Kill her.

### Round 5

**Player: ApeofJustice/Doishy
Opponent: Doishy/ApeofJustic   
Opposing Deck: THE MIRROR!  
Result: Madness**

**ApeofJustice:**

I played against Doishy.  
It was a wonderfully fun game and I couldn’t do this game justice with regards
to the report.

**Doishy:**

Round 5 is something truly special. Round 5 vs ApeofJustice on Doomsday.  
The 100% mirror.  
James on James, Doomsday on Doomsday action.  
It was everything everyone dreams of.

![Game Faces](/img/MirrorMatch.png)

> Ape (Front) feeling the pressure as Doishy (Back) gets super srs.

Game 1 he displays superior die skills and both of us wreck the hands of the
other. He manages to Doomsday first but it's a bluff and he sets up an easy PTT
pile. I school him by being excellent at casting brainstorms and combo him out
with a Storm pile and LM beats (did I mention I had a LM beating down during
this game?).  
Game 2 he once again tries to imply foul things about my heritage by throwing 10
Goblins and a flashbacked Cabal Therapy my way. I take a hit and, after checking
what was up, state my inability to combat maths to then proceed to then Throw 14
Goblins down in response. (I think I managed to CT two Doomsdays this game at
some point). I am on 6 life at this point but find a Doomsday so ignore the
board because urgh, creatures and cast it setting up a CB ToA loop stack. He
draws and SURGICALS ME, WHAT SORT OF DAMN PERSON BRINGS SURGICAL INTO A FIGHT
BETWEEN GENTLEMEN?! It's probably fine as I now look at my five randomised
cards. I draw the Tendrils first which then gets hit by Discard. Thankfully the
next one drawn is AoI so I then storm him some and flunge with SUPERIOR
CREATURES for the rest. I then write down my 2-0 as an 0-2 because breakers and
wanting Doomsday in the Top 8 over personal glory but alas it was for naught
because there was a big tie of people on six points and who even knows how that
shit works anyways?.
