 Deja vous again! Like a reccurring nightmare, you seem to be trapped in an
 endless stream of game 2's against a very vengeful Death and Taxes player.
 Whilst ahead a game in game 2. You find yourself up against a lot of hate. You
 are stuck at 5 life facing down an even greater variety of hatebears and a Rest
 in Peace to boot! The opponent only has a Swords to Plowshares in hand but, as
 they only have one mana source open, their own Thalia is preventing them from
 casting it. What is worse is you've already lost an Oracle to a prior Swords.
 Despite this never ceasing, targeted aggression there is still a way to
 navigate this horde. Win this turn!
solution: "[-,-,-,-,-]"
solutionNotes: >
 Following on from how we started our tier 2 solution, there is another
 potential out to this scenario. We can utilise the unique properties of this
 board state and build ourselves our own, homebrewed Leveler effect. This is a
 puzzle that requires a little bit of thinking outside the proverbial box.

 Cast Chain of Vapor for UU targeting the your Oracle, use the Chain ability and
 sacrifice a land to copy it and bounce Thalia. Cast a Ritual netting BBB and
 use it to cast Doomsday. We are not going to pay for the Leonin Arbiter tax
 this time. Why? Because with Rest in Peace present and us forbidden from
 searching our library thanks to the Arbiter, we now successfully exile our
 entire deck. Cast the Lotus Petal in hand and crack both Petals in play for UU.
 Cast the Oracle to win with 0 cards in our library.

 If you got a different solution please feel free to share it on the Discord!
 Well done!
