  Deja vous! Whilst ahead a game in game 2. You find yourself up against a lot
  of hate. You are stuck at 5 life facing down a variety of hatebears and a Rest
  in Peace to boot! The opponent only has a Swords to Plowshares in hand but, as
  they only have one mana source open, their own Thalia is preventing them from
  casting it. What is worse is you've already lost an Oracle to a prior Swords.
  Despite this continued targeted aggression there is still a way to navigate
  this horde. Win this turn!
solution:
  - Lotus Petal
  - Predict
  - Lion's Eye Diamond
  - Ponder
  - X
solutionNotes: >
  As before, there are a number of potential solutions so the one listed is
  likely not the only one available. In this scenario we have to be cautious of
  keeping the second (and thereby last) Oracle alive and safe from the Swords to
  Plowshares in the opponent's hand. As a result, we need to build a Brainstorm
  pile that allows us to put Oracle in our stack without accidentally losing it
  to an LED activation.

  Cast Chain of Vapor for UU targeting the your Oracle, use the Chain ability
  and sacrifice a land to copy it and bounce Thalia. Cast both Rituals netting
  BBBBB and use them to pay 2 for Leonin Arbiter and BBB for Doomsday. With
  Doomsday, stack [Lotus Petal, Predict, Lion's Eye Diamond, Ponder, X]. Here we
  need to ensure we cast Brainstorm as our first cantrip drawing LP, Predict and
  LED and putting back [Edge of Autumn and Thassa's Oracle]. Cast both Petals in
  hand along with the LED. Crack the petals for UU to cast Predict, cracking LED
  in response for UUU, exiling Edge of Autumn and drawing Oracle, Ponder. Use
  one of the U for Ponder to draw X and finally use the final UU to cast Oracle,
  winning with 0 cards left in your library and safely ignoring the Swords to
  Plowshares.

  If you got a different solution they may be covered in the later tiers of this
  scenario.
