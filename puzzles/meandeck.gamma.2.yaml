 Deja vous! Whilst ahead a game in game 2. You find yourself up against a lot of
 hate. You are stuck at 5 life facing down a variety of hatebears and a Rest in
 Peace to boot! The opponent only has a Swords to Plowshares in hand but, as
 they only have one mana source open, their own Thalia is preventing them from
 casting it. What is worse is you've already lost an Oracle to a prior Swords.
 Despite this continued targeted aggression there is still a way to navigate
 this horde. Win this turn!
solution: "[Lotus Petal, Predict, Lion's Eye Diamond, Ponder, X]"
solutionNotes: >
 As before, there are a number of potential solutions so the one listed is
 likely not the only one available. In this scenario we have to be cautious of
 keeping the second (and thereby last) Oracle alive and safe from the Swords to
 Plowshares in the opponent's hand. As a result, we need to build a Brainstorm
 pile that allows us to put Oracle in our stack without accidentally losing it
 to an LED activation.

 Cast Chain of Vapor for UU targeting the your Oracle, use the Chain ability and
 sacrifice a land to copy it and bounce Thalia. Cast both Rituals netting BBBBB
 and use them to pay 2 for Leonin Arbiter and BBB for Doomsday. With Doomsday,
 stack [Lotus Petal, Predict, Lion's Eye Diamond, Ponder, X]. Here we need to
 ensure we cast Brainstorm as our first cantrip drawing LP, Predict and LED and
 putting back [Edge of Autumn and Thassa's Oracle]. Cast both Petals in hand
 along with the LED. Crack the petals for UU to cast Predict, cracking LED in
 response for UUU, exiling Edge of Autumn and drawing Oracle, Ponder. Use one of
 the U for Ponder to draw X and finally use the final UU to cast Oracle, winning
 with 0 cards left in your library and safely ignoring the Swords to Plowshares.

 If you got a different solution they may be covered in the later tiers of this
 scenario.
