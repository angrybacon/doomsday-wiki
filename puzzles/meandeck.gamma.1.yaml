notes: >
  Whilst ahead a game in game 2. You find yourself up against a lot of hate. You
  are stuck at 5 life facing down a variety of hatebears and a Rest in Peace to
  boot! The opponent only has a Swords to Plowshares in hand but, as they only
  have one mana source open, their own Thalia is preventing them from casting
  it. Despite this targeted aggression there is still a way to navigate this
  horde. Win this turn!
solution:
  - Lion's Eye Diamond
  - Predict
  - X
  - X
  - Thassa's Oracle
solutionNotes: >
  There are in fact a number of potential solutions to this one. The first one
  is pretty simple. Two Dark Rituals handily provide both the mana for casting
  Doomsday and an additional BB for paying Leonin Arbiter's tax.

  Cast Chain of Vapor for UU targeting the Thalia. Cast both Rituals netting
  BBBBB and use them to pay 2 for Leonin Arbiter and BBB for Doomsday. With
  Doomsday, stack [Lion's Eye Diamond, Predict, X, X, Thassa's Oracle]. This
  then becomes a very simple "double cantrip" pile using one of either
  Brainstorm or Edge to draw LED, then use the other to draw Predict, holding
  priority to crack LED for UUU. You predict away X and draw the Oracle. Play
  the Oracle to win with 0 cards left in the library thereby negating the
  opposing Swords to Plowshares.

  If you got a different solution they may be covered in the later tiers of this
  scenario.
