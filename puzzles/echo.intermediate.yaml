  This is post-sideboard, and as you can see you have sided in your bounce
  spells. Opponent is at 20 life, you are at 9 life. There are currently 5 cards
  in your graveyard.
solution:
  - Echoing Truth
  - Lotus Petal
  - Lotus Petal
  - Tendrils of Agony
  - X
solutionNotes: >
  The Chain of Vapor and the Chalice on 1 are red herrings, and you can win
  without ever casting a 1-cmc spell. Crack the fetchland for a Badlands, and
  cast the Cabal Rituals off Petal and Swamp to make sure you have Threshold.
  Now you'll have BBBBBBBB floating. Play LED, Wish for a Draw4, and cast it
  cracking LED for BBB. Cast the 2 petals to bounce the Prelate and you have
  plenty of black mana left to cast Tendrils for a storm count of 11.
