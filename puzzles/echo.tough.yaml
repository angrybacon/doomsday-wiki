  Your life total is very low so a Draw4 is not an option. Your opponent is
  playing a Force of Will deck, so refilling their hand with an Echo pile is not
  ideal. But there is another option. You have a ton of blue mana available so
  you can cycle some cantrips to build storm. Cast the Doomsday using your
  black-producing lands. Cast the Lotus Petal and use it to Brainstorm. Keep the
  top 3 cards of the pile, and put back the Wish and the extra Doomsday. Play
  the LEDs, and now you can Ponder into Ponders, until you run out, then wish
  for Tendrils of Agony. This should give you a storm count of exactly 10.
