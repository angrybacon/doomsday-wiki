  After a bit of a grind you find yourself in an awkward spot. You are at 8 life
  with the combo ready but you have both LED and Oracle in hand and worst of all
  have failed to include Unearth in your deck. It's probably fine, you'll just
  have to improvise! Win this turn.
solution:
  - Brainstorm
  - Preordain
  - Edge of Autumn
  - Lotus Petal
  - Preordain

  So we need to make sure of two things. First of all, that we do not drop our
  life total to three because then Ballista can just kill us so we cannot use
  Street Wraith or any fetchland tricks. We also need to make sure we do end up
  with a pile that gives us zero cards in the deck when Oracle resolves as
  Ballista could kill the fish. Finally we need to make sure we do not discard
  Oracle to the LED because without a second Doomsday (which then takes us below
  lethal Ballista range anyways) we have no way to retrieve Oracle. This is a
  handy example of a Brainstorm pile!

  Use the Swamp to play the Ritual and Doomsday. The Island to cast Astrolabe
  drawing Brainstorm. This lets you draw Preordain, Edge and Petal and put back
  Oracle then Preordain. You then play LED and Petal. Cycle Edge, cracking LED
  for UUU, to draw Preordain. Preordain Oracle the to bottom and draw the second
  Preordain. Play the second Preordain and draw Oracle. Cast Oracle from the
  Petal and the final U floating from the LED.
