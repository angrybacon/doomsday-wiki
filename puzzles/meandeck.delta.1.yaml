  After a bit of a grind you find yourself in an awkward spot. You are at 8 life
  with the combo ready but you have both LED and Oracle in hand and worst of all
  have failed to include Unearth in your deck. It's probably fine, you'll just
  have to improvise! Win this turn.
solution:
  - Brainstorm
  - Preordain
  - Edge of Autumn
  - Lotus Petal
  - Preordain

  So we need to make sure of two things. First of all, that we do not drop our life
  total to three because then Ballista can just kill us so we cannot use Street Wraith
  or any fetchland tricks. We also need to make sure we do end up with a pile that gives
  us zero cards in the deck when Oracle resolves as Ballista could kill the fish. Finally
  we need to make sure we do not discard Oracle to the LED because without a second Doomsday
  (which then takes us below lethal Ballista range anyways) we have no way to retrieve Oracle.
  This is a handy example of a Brainstorm pile!
  
  Use the Swamp to play the Ritual and Doomsday. The Island to cast Astrolabe drawing Brainstorm.
  This lets you draw Preordain, Edge and Petal and put back Oracle then Preordain. You then play
  LED and Petal. Cycle Edge, cracking LED for UUU, to draw Preordain. Preordain Oracle the to 
  bottom and draw the second Preordain. Play the second Preordain and draw Oracle. Cast Oracle 
  from the Petal and the final U floating from the LED.
