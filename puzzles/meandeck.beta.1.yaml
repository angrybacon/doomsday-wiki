notes: >
  In game 3, you find yourself at 9 life facing down some lethal beaters.
  Between the Leyline, pitching cards to Force of Will and the Thoughtknot Seer
  you have lost both copies of Predict and your second Oracle to exile. Despite
  this you find a line and take it home to win the match. Win this turn.
solution:
  - Chain of Vapor
  - Street Wraith
  - X
  - X
  - X
solutionNotes: >
  The key thing to remember here actually lies within one of the opponent's
  cards. Thoughtknot Seer, when it leaves the battlefield, causes opponents to
  draw a card. You can use this to your advantage alongside Chain of Vapor's
  copy clause to both pick up your own Oracle and re-play it as well as netting
  another draw into the stack. You also have to be wary of the Walking Ballista
  as too much life loss through Street Wraith cycles can leave you dead to it.

  Cast Dark Ritual into Doomsday and stack [Chain of Vapor, Street Wraith, X, X,
  X]. Cycle Edge of Autumn (sacrificing the tapped Tropical Island), hold
  priority to crack LED for UUU, to draw Chain of Vapor. Cast Chain targeting
  your own Oracle, copy it, sacrificing your second land to bounce the opposing
  Thoughtknot Seer. Seer with trigger causing you to draw Street Wraith. Cycle
  Street Wraith (going from 4 life post Doomsday to 2 life post Cycle) to draw
  X. Cast Oracle and win with two cards left in the library.
