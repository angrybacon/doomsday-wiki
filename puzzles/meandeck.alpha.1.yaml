notes: >
  Playing against your Snowko opponent you are at 8 life and are faced with
  lethal on board. You know from previous Thoughtseizes that they have Force of
  Negation and a blue card in hand. You think you've found a line that shows
  them why the Elk king is dead. You have already made a land drop. Win this
  turn.
solution:
  - Brainstorm
  - Thassa's Oracle
  - Edge of Autumn
  - Lion's Eye Diamond
  - X
solutionNotes: >
  Being at so low a life is tricky here. You have a couple of options however
  one of them relies on your opponent's sequencing so should be avoided. If your
  opponent tries to Force of Negation the Doomsday on the stack you have the
  option to crack your fetch in response and build this pile: [Predict, Thassa's
  Oracle, Edge of Autumn, Lotus Petal, Unearth] however, if you crack the
  fetchland prior to casting Doomsday and they don't cast Force of Negation you
  are dead to them trying to Force the Predict post Doomsday. Because of this,
  the fetchland should be considered a red herring and ignored. The solution
  pile listed can be used no matter what point the opponent tries to fight over
  your spells. So worst case scenario, post Doomsday, you go from 4 life, cycle
  Street Wraith to 2 life and have 1 life left to cast Force of Will.

  Cast Dark Ritual into Doomsday and stack [Brainstorm, Thassa's Oracle, Edge of
  Autumn, Lion's Eye Diamond, X].

  Cycle Wraith into Brainstorm. Cast the Brainstorm and draw Oracle, Edge and
  LED. Put back Oracle and Underground Sea. Play LED. Cycle Edge of Autumn and
  hold priority, cracking LED for UUU. Draw Oracle and cast Oracle with U
  floating. You will win with two cards left in your library.
