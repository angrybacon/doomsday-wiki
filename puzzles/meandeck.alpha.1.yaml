deckFile: "BUG_Meandeck.json"
oppHand: "Force of Negation, Ponder"
oppBoard: "Elk, Elk, Elk, Oko, Thief of Crowns"
yourHand: "Dark Ritual, Doomsday, Force of Will, Force of Will, Street Wraith, Underground Sea"
yourBoard: >
  Polluted Delta, Swamp, Underground Sea
situationNotes: >
  Playing against your Snowko opponent you are at 8 life and are faced with lethal on board.
  You know from previous Thoughtseizes that they have Force of Negation and a blue card in hand. 
  You think you've found a line that shows them why the Elk king is dead. 
  Win this turn.
solution: "[Brainstorm, Thassa's Oracle, Edge of Autumn, Lion's Eye Diamond, X]"
solutionNotes: >
  Being at so low a life is tricky here. You have a couple of options however one of them 
  relies on your opponent's sequencing so should be avoided. If your opponent tries to Force
  of Negation the Doomsday on the stack you have the option to crack your fetch in response and
  build this pile: [Predict, Thassa's Oracle, Edge of Autumn, Lotus Petal, Unearth] however,
  if you crack the fetch land prior to casting Doomsday and they don't cast Force of Negation you
  are dead to them trying to Force the Predict post Doomsday. Because of this, the fetch land
  should be considered a Red Herring and ignored. The solution pile listed can be used no matter
  what point the opponent tries to fight over your spells. So worst case scenario, post Doomsday,
  you go from 4 life, cycle Street Wraith to 2 life and have 1 life spell to cast Force of Will.
  
  Cast Dark Ritual into Doomsday and stack [Brainstorm, Thassa's Oracle, Edge of Autumn, Lion's Eye Diamond, X].
  Cycle Wraith into Brainstorm. Cast the Brainstorm and draw Oracle, Edge and LED. Put back Oracle
  and Underground Sea. Play LED. Cycle Edge of Autumn and hold priority, cracking LED for UUU. 
  Draw Oracle and cast Oracle with U floating. You will win with two cards left in your library.
