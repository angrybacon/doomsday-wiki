notes: >
  Turn 1 on the draw in game 1 your Dredge opponent runs out a classic Faithless
  Looting x Lion's Eye Diamond turn however they don't hit a Therapy despite
  being ready to deal a lot of damage next turn. You draw your card for the turn
  and smile as you have a turn 1 win. Win this turn.
solution:
  - Lotus Petal
  - Lion's Eye Diamond
  - Edge of Autumn
  - Preordain
  - X
solutionNotes: >
  The main thing to see here is the fact we have a decent Brainstorm pile, but
  no U to cast Brainstorm. Street Wraith makes this easy then to find the U
  source and put Oracle back into the pile. You cycle the Wraith into the Petal
  that allows you to cast Brainstorm. You put back Preordain and Oracle. Cast
  LED, cycle, crack for UUU and cast Preordain into Oracle. If you are running a
  third "free-cycle" card you can play around removal too by having X as another
  Street Wraith.
