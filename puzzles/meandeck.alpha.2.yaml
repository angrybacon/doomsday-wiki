situationNotes: >
  Tier 2: Very similar to last game you have the same setup as before. At 8 life
  and facing down a lethal board, even despite your loyal Strix thanks to their
  removal in hand. Despite the trials faced, you still see a way out. Win this
  turn.
solution: >
  [Brainstorm, Ponder, Edge of Autumn, Lion's Eye Diamond, Thassa's Oracle]
solutionNotes: >
  As with the first puzzle of this scenario you have to take the same
  considerations with your life total in hand however, there is a chance (albeit
  a slim one) that the opponent will pull the trigger on their Swords to
  Plowshares too early netting you the one life that opens up use of the
  fetchland in play. As stated before however we shouldn't assume our opponent
  will make a mistake. The stack works the same way as before however we move
  the Oracle to the bottom of the stack and replace it with a Ponder.

  Cast Dark Ritual into Doomsday and stack [Brainstorm, Ponder, Edge of Autumn,
  Lion's Eye Diamond, Thassa's Oracle].

  Cycle Wraith into Brainstorm. Cast the Brainstorm and draw Ponder, Edge and
  LED. Put back Ponder and Underground Sea. Play LED. Cycle Edge of Autumn and
  hold priority, cracking LED for UUU. Draw Ponder and cast Ponder with UU
  floating. Arrange to draw the Oracle and then cast Oracle for UU. You will win
  with one card left in your library. Thanks to the presence of our Baleful
  Strix we have a spare devotion to blue that stays even if they cast Swords to
  Plowshares on the Oracle as a response to its trigger.
