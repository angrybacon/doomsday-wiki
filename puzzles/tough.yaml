solutionNotes: >
  Your life total is very low so a Draw4 is not an option. Your opponent is
  playing a Force of Will deck, so refilling their hand with an Echo pile is
  not ideal. But there is another option. You have a ton of blue mana
  available so you can cycle some cantrips to build storm. Cast the Doomsday
  using your black-producing lands. Cast the Lotus Petal and use it to
  Brainstorm. Keep the top 3 cards of the pile, and put back the Wish and the
  extra Doomsday. Play the LEDs, and now you can Ponder into Ponders, until
  you run out, then wish for Tendrils of Agony. This should give you a storm
  count of exactly 10.
